<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE UNEXPECTED SUCCESS</span></p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">No other area offers richer opportunities for successful innovation than the unexpected success. In no other area are innovative opportunities less risky and their pursuit less arduous. Yet the unexpected success is almost totally neglected; worse, managements tend actively to reject it.</p>
<p class="para">Here is one example.</p>
<p class="para">More than thirty years ago, I was told by the chairman of New York’s largest department store, R. H. Macy, “We don’t know how to stop the growth of appliance sales.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why do you want to stop them?” I asked, quite mystified. “Are you losing money on them?”</p>
<p class="para">“On the contrary,” the chairman said, “profit margins are better than on fashion goods; there are no returns, and practically no pilferage.”</p>
<p class="para">“Do the appliance customers keep away the fashion customers?” I asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, no,” was the answer. “Where we used to sell appliances primarily to people who came in to buy fashions, we now sell fashions very often to people who come in to buy appliances. But,” the chairman continued, “in this kind of store, it is normal and healthy for fashion to produce seventy percent of sales. Appliance sales have grown so fast that they now account for three-fifths. And that’s abnormal. We’ve tried everything we know to make fashion grow to restore the normal ratio, but nothing works. The only thing left now is to push appliance sales down to where they should be.”</p>
<a id="page46" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">For almost twenty years after this episode, Macy’s New York continued to drift. Any number of explanations were given for Macy’s inability to exploit its dominant position in the New York retail market: the decay of the inner city, the poor economics of a store supposedly “too big,” and many others. Actually, once a new management came in after 1970, reversed the emphasis, and accepted the contribution of appliances to sales, Macy’s—despite inner-city decay, despite its high labor costs, and despite its enormous size—promptly began to prosper again.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time that Macy’s rejected the unexpected success, another New York retail store, Bloomingdale’s, used the identical unexpected success to propel itself into the number two spot in the New York market. Bloomingdale’s, at best a weak number four, had been even more of a fashion store than Macy’s. But when appliance sales began to climb in the early 1950s, Bloomingdale’s ran with the opportunity. It realized that something unexpected was happening and analyzed it. It then built a new position in the marketplace around its Housewares Department. It also refocused its fashion and apparel sales to reach a new customer: the customer of whose emergence the explosion in appliance sales was only a symptom. Macy’s is still number one in New York in volume. But Bloomingdale’s has become the “smart New York store.” And the stores that were the contenders for this title thirty years ago—the stores that were then strong number twos, the fashion leaders of 1950 such as Best—have disappeared (for additional examples, see Chapter 15).</p>
<p class="para">The Macy’s story will be called extreme. But the only uncommon aspect about it is that the chairman was aware of what he was doing. Though not conscious of their folly, far too many managements act the way Macy’s did. It is never easy for a management to accept the unexpected success. It takes determination, specific policies, a willingness to look at reality, and the humility to say, “We were wrong!”</p>
<p class="para">One reason why it is difficult for management to accept unexpected success is that all of us tend to believe that anything that has lasted a fair amount of time must be “normal” and go on “forever.” Anything that contradicts what we have come to consider a law of nature is then rejected as unsound, unhealthy, and obviously abnormal.</p>
<p class="para">This explains, for instance, why one of the major U.S. steel companies, around 1970, rejected the “mini-mill.”<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote10.html" id="footnote10" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> Management knew that <a id="page47" class="calibre"></a>its steelworks were rapidly becoming obsolete and would need billions of dollars of investment to be modernized. It also knew that it could not obtain the necessary sums. A new, smaller “mini-mill” was the solution.</p>
<p class="para">Almost by accident, such a “mini-mill” was acquired. It soon began to grow rapidly and to generate cash and profits. Some of the younger men within the steel company therefore proposed that the available investment funds be used to acquire additional “mini-mills” and to build new ones. Within a few years, the “mini-mills” would then give the steel company several million tons of steel capacity based on modern technology, low labor costs, and pinpointed markets. Top management indignantly vetoed the proposal; indeed, all the men who had been connected with it found themselves “ex-employees” within a few years. “The integrated steelmaking process is the only right one,” top management argued. “Everything else is cheating—a fad, unhealthy, and unlikely to endure.” Needless to say, ten years later the only parts of the steel industry in America that were still healthy, growing, and reasonably prosperous were “mini-mills.”</p>
<p class="para">To a steelmaker who has spent his entire life working to perfect the integrated steelmaking process, who is at home in the big steel mill, and who may himself be the son of a steelworker (as a great many American steel company executives have been), anything but “big steel” is strange and alien, indeed a threat. It takes an effort to perceive in the “enemy” one’s own best opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">Top management people in most organizations, whether small or large, public-service institution or business, have typically grown up in one function or one area. To them, this is the area in which they feel comfortable. When I sat down with the chairman of R. H. Macy, for instance, there was only one member of top management, the personnel vice-president, who had not started as a fashion buyer and made his career in the fashion end of the business. Appliances, to these men, were something that other people dealt with.</p>
<p class="para">The unexpected success can be galling. Consider the company that has worked diligently on modifying and perfecting an old product, a product that has been the “flagship” of the company for years, the product that represents “quality.” At the same time, most reluctantly, the company puts through what everyone in the firm knows is a perfectly meaningless modification of an old, obsolete, and “low-quality” product. It is done only because one of the company’s leading salesmen <a id="page48" class="calibre"></a>lobbied for it, or because a good customer asked for it and could not be turned down. But nobody expects it to sell; in fact, nobody wants it to sell. And then this “dog” runs away with the market and even takes the sales which plans and forecasts had promised for the “prestige,” “quality” line. No wonder that everybody is appalled and considers the success a “cuckoo in the nest” (a term I have heard more than once). Everybody is likely to react precisely the way the chairman of R. H. Macy reacted when he saw the unwanted and unloved appliances overtake his beloved fashions, on which he himself had spent his working life and his energy.</p>
<p class="para">The unexpected success is a challenge to management’s judgment. “If the mini-mills were an opportunity, we surely would have seen it ourselves,” the chairman of the big steel company is quoted as saying when he turned the mini-mill proposal down. Managements are paid for their judgment, but they are not being paid to be infallible. In fact, they are being paid to realize and admit that they have been wrong—especially when their admission opens up an opportunity. But this is by no means common.</p>
<p class="para">A Swiss pharmaceutical company today has world leadership in veterinary medicines, yet it has not itself developed a single veterinary drug. But the companies that developed these medicines refused to serve the veterinary market. The medicines, mostly antibiotics, were of course developed for treating human diseases. When the veterinarians discovered that they were just as effective for animals and began to send in their orders, the original manufacturers were far from pleased. In some cases they refused to supply the veterinarians; in many others, they disliked having to reformulate the drugs for animal use, to repackage them, and so on. The medical director of a leading pharmaceutical company protested around 1953 that to apply a new antibiotic to the treatment of animals was a “misuse of a noble medicine.” Consequently, when the Swiss approached this manufacturer and several others, they obtained licenses for veterinary use without any difficulty and at low cost. Some of the manufacturers were only too happy to get rid of the embarrassing success.</p>
<p class="para">Human medications have since come under price pressure and are carefully scrutinized by regulatory authorities. This has made veterinary medications the most profitable segment of the pharmaceutical industry. But the companies that developed the compounds in the first place are not the ones who get these profits.</p>
<a id="page49" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">Far more often, the unexpected success is simply not seen at all. Nobody pays any attention to it. Hence, nobody exploits it, with the inevitable result that the competitor runs with it and reaps the rewards.</p>
<p class="para">A leading hospital supplier introduced a new line of instruments for biological and clinical tests. The new products were doing quite well. Then, suddenly, orders came in from industrial and university laboratories. Nobody was told about them, nobody noticed them; nobody realized that, by pure accident, the company had developed products with more and better customers outside the market for which those products had been developed. No salesman was being sent out to call on these new customers, no service force was being set up. Five or eight years later, another company had taken over these new markets. And because of the volume of business these markets produced, the newcomer could soon invade the hospital market offering lower prices and better services than the original market leader.</p>
<p class="para">One reason for this blindness to the unexpected success is that our existing reporting systems do not as a rule report it, let alone clamor for management’s attention.</p>
<p class="para">Practically every company—but every public-service institution as well—has a monthly or quarterly report. The first sheet lists the areas in which performance is below expectations: it lists the problems and the shortfalls. At the monthly meetings of the management group and the board of directors, everybody therefore focuses on the problem areas. No one even looks at the areas where the company has done better than expected. And if the unexpected success is not quantitative but qualitative—as in the case of the hospital instruments mentioned above, which opened up new major markets outside the company’s traditional ones—the figures will not even show the unexpected success as a rule.</p>
<p class="para">To exploit the opportunity for innovation offered by unexpected success requires analysis. Unexpected success is a symptom. But a symptom of what? The underlying phenomenon may be nothing more than a limitation on our own vision, knowledge, and understanding. That the pharmaceutical companies, for instance, rejected the unexpected success of their new drugs in the animal market was a symptom of their own failure to know how big—and how important—livestock raising throughout the world is; of their blindness to the sharp increase in demand for animal proteins throughout the world after World War II, <a id="page50" class="calibre"></a>and to the tremendous changes in knowledge, sophistication, and management capacity of the world’s farmers.</p>
<p class="para">The unexpected success of appliances at R. H. Macy’s was a symptom of a fundamental change in the behavior, expectations, and values of substantial numbers of consumers—as the people at Bloomingdale’s realized. Up until World War II, department store consumers in the United States bought primarily by socioeconomic status, that is, by income group. After World War II, the market increasingly segmented itself by what we now call “lifestyles.” Bloomingdale’s was the first of the major department stores, especially on the East Coast, to realize this, to capitalize on it, and to innovate a new retail image.</p>
<p class="para">The unexpected success of laboratory instruments designed for the hospital in industrial and university laboratories was a symptom of the disappearance of distinctions between the various users of scientific instruments, which for almost a century had created sharply different markets, with different end uses, specifications, and expectations. What it symptomized—and the company never realized this—was not just that a product line had uses that were not originally envisaged. It signaled the end of the specific market niche the company had enjoyed in the hospital market. So the company that for thirty or forty years had successfully defined itself as a designer, maker, and marketer of hospital laboratory equipment was forced eventually to redefine itself as a maker of laboratory instruments, and to develop capabilities to design, manufacture, distribute, and service way beyond its original field. By then, however, it had lost a large part of the market for good.</p>
<p class="para">Thus the unexpected success is not just an opportunity for innovalion; it demands innovation. It forces us to ask, What basic changes are now appropriate for this organization in the way it defines its business? Its technology? Its markets? If these questions are faced up to, then the unexpected success is likely to open up the most rewarding and least risky of all innovative opportunities.</p>
<p class="para">Two of the world’s biggest businesses, DuPont, the world’s largest chemical company, and IBM, the giant of the computer industry, owe their preeminence to their willingness to exploit the unexpected success as an innovative opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">DuPont, for 130 years, had confined itself to making munitions and explosives. In the mid-1920s it then organized its first research efforts in other areas, one of them the brand-new field of polymer chemistry, which the Germans had pioneered during World War I. For several <a id="page51" class="calibre"></a>years there were no results at all. Then, in 1928, an assistant left a burner on over the weekend. On Monday morning, Wallace H. Carothers, the chemist in charge, found that the stuff in the kettle had congealed into fibers. It took another ten years before DuPont found out how to make Nylon intentionally. The point of the story is, however, that the same accident had occurred several times in the laboratories of the big German chemical companies with the same results, and much earlier. The Germans were, of course, looking for a polymerized fiber—and they could have had it, along with world leadership in the chemical industry, ten years before DuPont had Nylon. But because they had not planned the experiment, they dismissed its results, poured out the accidentally produced fibers, and started all over again.</p>
<p class="para">The history of IBM equally shows what paying attention to the unexpected success can do. For IBM is largely the result of the willingness to exploit the unexpected success not once, but twice. In the early 1930s, IBM almost went under. It had spent its available money on designing the first electro-mechanical bookkeeping machine, meant for banks. But American banks did not buy new equipment in the Depression days of the early thirties. IBM even then had a policy of not laying off people, so it continued to manufacture the machines, which it had to put in storage.</p>
<p class="para">When IBM was at its lowest point—so the story goes—Thomas Watson, Sr., the founder, found himself at a dinner party sitting next to a lady. When she heard his name, she said: “Are you the Mr. Watson of IBM? Why does your sales manager refuse to demonstrate your machine to me?” What a lady would want with an accounting machine Thomas Watson could not possibly figure out, nor did it help him much when she told him she was the director of the New York Public Library; it turned out he had never been in a public library. But next morning, he appeared there as soon as its doors opened.</p>
<p class="para">In those days, libraries had fair amounts of government money. Watson walked out two hours later with enough of an order to cover next month’s payroll. And, as he added with a chuckle whenever he told the story, “I invented a new policy on the spot: we get cash in advance before we deliver.”</p>
<p class="para">Fifteen years later, IBM had one of the early computers. Like the other early American computers, the IBM computer was designed for scientific purposes only. Indeed, IBM got into computer work largely because of Watson’s interest in astronomy. And when first demon<a id="page52" class="calibre"></a>strated in IBM’s show window on Madison Avenue, where it drew enormous crowds, IBM’s computer was programmed to calculate all past, present, and future phases of the moon.</p>
<p class="para">But then businesses began to buy this “scientific marvel” for the most mundane of purposes, such as payroll. Univac, which had the most advanced computer and the one most suitable for business uses, did not really want to “demean” its scientific miracle by supplying business. But IBM, though equally surprised by the business demand for computers, responded immediately. Indeed, it was willing to sacrifice its own computer design, which was not particularly suitable for accounting, and instead use what its rival and competitor (Univac) had developed. Within four years IBM had attained leadership in the computer market, even though for another decade its own computers were technically inferior to those produced by Univac. IBM was willing to satisfy business and to satisfy it on business’ terms—to train programmers for business, for instance.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, Japan’s foremost electronic company, Matsushita (better known by its brand names Panasonic and National), owes its rise to its willingness to run with unexpected success.</p>
<p class="para">Matsushita was a fairly small and undistinguished company in the early 1950s, outranked on every count by such older and deeply entrenched giants as Toshiba or Hitachi. Matsushita “knew,” as did every other Japanese manufacturer of the time, that “television would not grow fast in Japan.” “Japan is much too poor to afford such a luxury,” the chairman of Toshiba had said at a New York meeting around 1954 or 1955. Matsushita, however, was intelligent enough to accept that the Japanese farmers apparently did not know that they were too poor for television. What they knew was that television offered them, for the first time, access to a big world. They could not afford television sets, but they were prepared to buy them anyhow and pay for them. Toshiba and Hitachi made better sets at the time, only they showed them on the Ginza in Tokyo and in the big-city department stores, making it pretty clear that farmers were not particularly welcome in such elegant surroundings. Matsushita went to the farmers and sold its televisions door-to-door, something no one in Japan had ever done before for anything more expensive than cotton pants or aprons.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, it is not enough to depend on accidents, nor to wait for the lady at the dinner table to express unexpected interest in one’s apparently failing product. The search has to be organized.</p>
<a id="page53" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">The first thing is to ensure that the unexpected is being seen; indeed, that it clamors for attention. It must be properly featured in the information management obtains and studies. (How to do this is described in some detail in Chapter 13.)</p>
<p class="para">Managements must look at every unexpected success with the questions: (1) What would it mean to us if we exploited it? (2) Where could it lead us? (3) What would we have to do to convert it into an opportunity? And (4) How do we go about it? This means, first, that managements need to set aside specific time in which to discuss unexpected successes; and second, that someone should always be designated to analyze an unexpected success and to think through how it could be exploited.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="para">But management also needs to learn what the unexpected success demands of them. Again, this might best be explained by an example.</p>
<p class="para">A major university on the eastern seaboard of the United States started, in the early 1950s, an evening program of “continuing education” for adults; in which the normal undergraduate curriculum leading to an undergraduate degree was offered to adults with a high school diploma.</p>
<p class="para">Nobody on the faculty really believed in the program. The only reason it was offered at all was that a small number of returning World War II veterans had been forced to go to work before obtaining their undergraduate degrees and were clamoring for an opportunity to get the credits they still lacked. To everybody’s surprise, however, the program proved immensely successful, with qualified students applying in large numbers. And the students in the program actually outperformed the regular undergraduates. This, in turn, created a dilemma. To exploit the unexpected success, the university would have had to build a fairly big first-rate faculty. But this would have weakened its main program; at the least, it would have diverted the university from what it saw as its main mission, the training of undergraduates. The alternative was to close down the new program. Either decision would have been a responsible one. Instead, the university decided to staff the program with cheap, temporary faculty, mostly teaching assistants working on their own advanced degrees. As a result, it destroyed the program within a few years; but worse, it also seriously damaged its own reputation.</p>
<p class="para">The unexpected success is an opportunity, but it makes demands. It <a id="page54" class="calibre"></a>demands to be taken seriously. It demands to be staffed with the ablest people available, rather than with whoever we can spare. It demands seriousness and support on the part of management equal to the size of the opportunity. And the opportunity is considerable.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA1">II</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE UNEXPECTED FAILURE</span></p>
<p class="para">Failures, unlike successes, cannot be rejected and rarely go unnoticed. But they are seldom seen as symptoms of opportunity. A good many failures are, of course, nothing but mistakes, the results of greed, stupidity, thoughtless bandwagon-climbing, or incompetence whether in design or execution. Yet if something fails despite being carefully planned, carefully designed, and conscientiously executed, that failure often bespeaks underlying change and, with it, opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">The assumptions on which a product or service, its design or its marketing strategy, were based may no longer fit reality. Perhaps customers have changed their values and perceptions; while they still buy the same “thing,” they are actually purchasing a very different “value.” Or perhaps what has always been one market or one end use is splitting itself into two or more, each demanding something quite different. Any change like this is an opportunity for innovation.</p>
<p class="para">I had my first experience with an unexpected failure at the very beginning of my working life, almost sixty years ago, just out of high school. My first job was as a trainee in an old export firm, which for more than a century had been selling hardware to British India. Its best seller for years had been a cheap padlock, of which it exported whole shiploads every month. The padlock was flimsy; a pin easily opened the lock. As incomes in India went up during the 1920s, padlock sales, instead of going up, began to decline quite sharply. My employer thereupon did the obvious: he redesigned the padlock to give it a sturdier lock, that is, to make it “better quality.” The added cost was minimal and the improvement in quality substantial. But the improved padlock turned out to be unsalable. Four years later, the firm went into liquidation, the decline of its Indian padlock business a major factor in its demise.</p>
<p class="para">A very small competitor of this firm in the Indian export business—no more than a tenth of the size of my employer and until then barely able to survive—realized that this unexpected failure was a symptom <a id="page55" class="calibre"></a>of basic change. For the bulk of Indians, the peasants in the villages, the padlock was (and for all I know, still is) a magical symbol; no thief would have dared open a padlock. The key was never used, and usually disappeared. To get a padlock that could not easily be opened without a key—the improved padlock my employer had worked so hard to perfect without additional cost—was thus not a boon but a disaster.</p>
<p class="para">A small but rapidly growing middle-class minority in the cities, however, needed a real lock. That it was not sturdy enough for their needs was the main reason why the old lock had begun to lose sales and market. But for them the redesigned product was still inadequate.</p>
<p class="para">My employer’s competitor broke down the padlock into two separate products: one without lock and key, with only a simple trigger release, and selling for one-third less than the old padlock but with twice its profit margin; and the other with a good sturdy lock and three keys, selling at twice the price of the old product and also with a substantially larger profit margin. Both lines immediately began to sell. Within two years, the competitor had become the largest European hardware exporter to India. He maintained this position for ten years, until World War II put an end to European exports to India altogether.</p>
<p class="para">A quaint tale from horse and buggy days, some might say. Surely we have become more sophisticated in this age of computers, of market research, and of business school MBAs.</p>
<p class="para">But here is another case, half a century later and from a very “sophisticated” industry. Yet it teaches exactly the same lesson.</p>
<p class="para">Just at the time when the first cohorts of the “baby boom” were reaching their mid-twenties—that is, the age to form families and to buy their first house—the 1973–74 recession hit. Inflation was becoming rampant, particularly in housing prices, which rose much faster than anything else. At the same time, interest rates on home mortgages were skyrocketing. And so the mass builders in America began to design and offer what they called a “basic house,” smaller, simpler, and cheaper than the house that had become standard.</p>
<p class="para">But despite its being such “good value” and well within the means of the first-time homebuyer, the “basic house” was a thumping failure. The builders tried to salvage it by offering low-interest financing and long repayment terms, and by slashing prices. Still, no one bought the “basic house.”</p>
<p class="para">Most homebuilders did what businessmen do in an unexpected failure: they blamed that old bogeyman, the “irrational customer.” But one <a id="page56" class="calibre"></a>builder, still very small, decided to look around. He found that there had been a change in what the young American couple wants in its first house. This no longer represents the family’s permanent home as it had done for their grandparents, a house in which the couple expects to live the rest of its life, or at least a long time. In the 1970s, young couples were buying not one, but two separate “values” in purchasing their first home. They bought shelter for a few short years; and they also bought an option to buy—a few years later—their “real” house, a much bigger and more luxurious home, in a better neighborhood, with better schools. To make the down payment on this far more expensive permanent home, they would, however, need the equity they had built up in the first house. The young people knew very well that the “basic house” was not what they and their contemporaries really wanted, even though it was all they could afford. They feared therefore—and perfectly rationally—that they would not be able to resell the “basic house” at a decent price. So the “basic house,” instead of being an option to buy the “real house” later on, would become a serious impediment to the fulfillment of their true housing needs and wants.</p>
<p class="para">The young couple of 1950 had still perceived itself as “working-class,” by and large. And “working-class” people in the West do not expect their incomes and their standards of living to rise materially once they are out of their apprenticeship and into a full-time job. Seniority, for working-class people (with Japan being the major exception), means greater job security rather than larger incomes. But the “middle class” traditionally can expect a steady increase in its income until the head of the household reaches age forty-five or forty-eight. Between 1950 and 1975, both the reality and the self-image of young American adults—their educations, their expectations, their jobs—had changed from “working-class” to “middle-class.” And with this change had come a sharp change in what the young people’s first home represented, and what “value” was connected with it.</p>
<p class="para">Once this was understood—and all it took was to listen to prospective homebuyers for a few weekends—successful innovation came about easily. Almost no change was made in the physical plant itself; only the kitchen was redesigned and made somewhat roomier. Otherwise, the building remained the same “basic house” the homebuilders had not been able to sell. But instead of being offered as “your house,” it was offered as “your <span class="italic">first</span> house,” and as a “building block toward the house you want.” Specifically, this meant that the young couple was <a id="page57" class="calibre"></a>shown both the house as it was standing—that is, the “basic house”—and a model of the same house in which future additions such as an extra bathroom, one or two more bedrooms, and a basement “family den” had been built. Indeed, the builder had already obtained the necessary city permits for conversion of the “basic house” to a “permanent home.” Furthermore, the builder guaranteed the young couple a fixed resale price for their first house, to be credited against their purchase from his firm of a second, bigger, “permanent” home within five to seven years. “This entailed practically no risk,” he explained. “The demographics were such, after all, as to guarantee a steady increase in the demand for ‘first houses’ until the late 1980s or 1990s, during which time the babies of the ‘baby bust’ of 1961 will have become twenty-five themselves and will start forming their own families.”</p>
<p class="para">Before this homebuilder transformed failure into innovation, he had operated in only one metropolitan area and was a small factor in it. Five years later, the firm was operating in seven metropolitan areas and was either number one or a strong number two in each of them. Even during the building recession of 1981–82—a recession so severe that some of the largest American builders did not sell one single new house during an entire season—this innovative homebuilder continued to grow. “One reason,” the firm’s founder explained, “was something even I had not seen when I decided to offer first-time homebuyers a repurchase guarantee. It gave us a steady supply of well-built and still fairly new houses that needed only a little fixing up and could then be resold at a very decent profit to the next crop of first-home buyers.”</p>
<p class="para">Faced with unexpected failure, executives, especially in large organizations, tend to call for more study and more analysis. But as both the padlock story and the “basic house” story show, this is the wrong response. The unexpected failure demands that you go out, look around, and listen. Failure should always be considered a symptom of an innovative opportunity, and taken seriously as such.</p>
<p class="para">It is equally important to watch out for the unexpected event in a supplier’s business, and among the customers. McDonald’s, for instance, started because the company’s founder, Ray Kroc, paid attention to the unexpected success of one of his customers. At that time Kroc was selling milkshake machines to hamburger joints. He noticed that one of his customers, a small hamburger stand in a remote California town, bought several times the number of milkshake machines its location <a id="page58" class="calibre"></a>and size could justify. He investigated and found an old man who had, in effect, reinvented the fast-food business by systematizing it. Kroc bought his outfit and built it into a billion-dollar business based on the original owner’s unexpected success.</p>
<p class="para">A competitor’s unexpected success or failure is equally important. In either case, one takes the event seriously as a possible symptom of innovative opportunity. One does not just “analyze.” One goes out to investigate.</p>
<p class="para">Innovation—and this is a main thesis of this book—is organized, systematic, rational work. But it is perceptual fully as much as conceptual. To be sure, what the innovator sees and learns has to be subjected to rigorous logical analysis. Intuition is not good enough; indeed, it is no good at all if by “intuition” is meant “what I feel.” For that usually is another way of saying “What I like it to be” rather than “What I perceive it to be.” But the analysis, with all its rigor—its requirements for testing, piloting, and evaluating—has to be based on a perception of change, of opportunity, of the new realities, of the incongruity between what most people still are quite sure is the reality and what has actually become a new reality. This requires the willingness to say: “I don’t know enough to analyze, but I shall find out. I’ll go out, look around, ask questions, and <span class="italic">listen.”</span></p>
<p class="para">It is precisely because the unexpected jolts us out of our preconceived notions, our assumptions, our certainties, that it is such a fertile source of innovation.</p>
<p class="para">It is not in fact even necessary for the entrepreneur to understand why reality has changed. In the two cases above, it was easy to find out what had happened and why. More often, we find out what is happening without much clue as to why. And yet we can still innovate successfully.</p>
<p class="para">Here is one example.</p>
<p class="para">The failure of the Ford Motor Company’s Edsel in 1957 has become American folklore. Even people who were not yet born when the Edsel failed have heard about it, at least in the United States. But the general belief that the Edsel was a slapdash gamble is totally mistaken.</p>
<p class="para">Very few products were ever more carefully designed, more carefully introduced, more skillfully marketed. The Edsel was intended to be the final step in the most thoroughly planned strategy in American business history: a ten-year campaign during which the Ford Motor Company converted itself after World War II from near-bankruptcy <a id="page59" class="calibre"></a>into an aggressive competitor, a strong number two in the United States, and a few years later, a strong contender for the number one spot in the rapidly growing European market.</p>
<p class="para">By 1957, Ford had already successfully reestablished itself as a strong competitor in three of the four main American automobile markets: the “standard” one with the Ford nameplate; the “lower-middle” one with Mercury; and the “upper” one with the Continental. The Edsel was then designed for the only remaining segment, the upper-middle one, the one for which Ford’s big rival, General Motors, produced the Buick and the Oldsmobile. This “upper-middle” segment was, in the period after World War II, the fastest-growing part of the automobile market and yet the one for which the third automobile producer, Chrysler, did not have a strong entry, thereby leaving the door wide open for Ford.</p>
<p class="para">Ford went to extreme lengths to plan and design the Edsel, embodying in its design the best information from market research, the best information about customer preferences in appearance and styling, and the highest standards of quality control.</p>
<p class="para">Yet the Edsel became a total failure right away.</p>
<p class="para">The reaction of the Ford Motor Company was very revealing. Instead of blaming the “irrational consumer,” the Ford people decided there was something happening that did not jibe with the assumptions about reality everyone in the automobile industry had been making about consumer behavior—and for so long that they had become unquestioned axioms.</p>
<p class="para">The result of Ford’s decision to go out and investigate was the one genuine innovation in the American automobile industry since Alfred P. Sloan, in the 1920s, had defined the socioeconomic segmentation of the American market into “low,” “lower-middle,” “upper-middle,” and “upper” segments, the insight on which he then built the General Motors Company. When the Ford people went out, they discovered that this segmentation was rapidly being replaced—or at least paralleled—by another quite different one, the one we would now call “lifestyle segmentation.” The result, within a short period after the Edsel’s failure, was the appearance of Ford’s Thunderbird, the greatest success of any American car since Henry Ford, Sr., had introduced his Model T in 1908. The Thunderbird established Ford again as a major producer in its own right, rather than as GM’s kid brother and a perennial imitator.</p>
<a id="page60" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">And yet to this day we really do not know what caused the change. It occurred well <span class="italic">before</span> any of the events by which it is usually explained, such as the shift of the center of demographic gravity to the teenagers as a result of the “baby boom,” the explosive expansion of higher education, or the change in sexual mores. Nor do we really know what is meant by “lifestyle.” All attempts to describe it have been futile so far. All we know is that something happened.</p>
<p class="para">But that is enough to convert the unexpected, whether success or failure, into an opportunity for effective and purposeful innovation.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA1">III</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE UNEXPECTED OUTSIDE EVENT</span></p>
<p class="para">Unexpected successes and unexpected failure have so far been discussed as occurring within a business or an industry. But outside events, that is, events that are not recorded in the information and the figures by which a management steers its institution, are just as important. Indeed, they often are more important.</p>
<p class="para">Here are some examples showing typical unexpected outside events and their exploitation as major opportunities for successful innovation.</p>
<p class="para">One example concerns IBM and the personal computer.</p>
<p class="para">However much executives and engineers at IBM may have disagreed with each other, there apparently was total agreement within the company on one point until well into the seventies: the future belonged to the centralized “main-frame” computer, with an ever larger memory and an ever larger calculating capacity. Everything else, every IBM engineer could prove convincingly, would be far too expensive, far too confusing, and far too limited in its performance capacity. And so IBM concentrated its efforts and resources on maintaining its leadership in the main-frame market.</p>
<p class="para">And then around 1975 or 1976, to everybody’s total surprise, ten-and eleven-year-old kids began to play computer games. Right away their fathers wanted their own office computer or personal computer, that is, a separate, small, freestanding machine with far less capacity than even the smallest main-frame has. All the dire things the IBM people had predicted actually did happen. The freestanding machines cost many times what a plug-in “terminal” costs, and they have far less capacity; there is such a proliferation of them and their programs, and <a id="page61" class="calibre"></a>so few of them are truly compatible with one another, that the whole field has become chaotic, with service and repairs in shambles. But this does not seem to bother the customers. On the contrary, in the U.S. market the personal computers in five short years—from 1979 to 1984—reached the annual sales volume it had taken the “main-frames” thirty years to reach, that is, $15–$16 billion.</p>
<p class="para">IBM could have been expected to dismiss this development. Instead, as early as 1977, when personal computer sales worldwide were still less than $200 million (as against main-frame sales of $7 billion for the same year), IBM set up task forces in competition with one another to develop personal computers for the company. As a result, IBM produced its own personal computer in 1980, just when the market was exploding. Three years later, in 1983, IBM had become the world’s leading personal computer producer with nearly as much of a leadership position in the new field as it had in main-frames. Also in 1983 IBM then introduced its own very small “home computer,” the “Peanut.”</p>
<p class="para">When I discuss all this with the IBM people, I always ask the same question: “What explains that IBM, of all people, saw this change as an opportunity when everybody at IBM was so totally sure that it couldn’t happen and made no sense?” And I always get the same answer: “Precisely because we <span class="italic">knew</span> that this couldn’t happen, and that it would make no sense at all, the development came as a profound shock to us. We realized that everything we’d assumed, everything we were so absolutely certain of, was suddenly being thrown into a cocked hat, and that we had to go out and organize ourselves to take advantage of a development we knew couldn’t happen, but which then did happen.”</p>
<p class="para">The second example is far more mundane. But is it no less instructive despite <span class="italic">its</span> lack of glamour.</p>
<p class="para">The United States has never been a <span class="italic">book-buying</span> country, in part because of the ubiquitous free public library. When TV appeared in the early fifties and more and more Americans began to spend more and more of their time in front of the tube—particularly people in their prime book-reading years, that is, people of high school and college age—“everyone knew” that book sales would drop drastically. Book publishers frantically began to diversify into “high-tech media”: educational movies, or computer programs (in most cases, with total lack of success). But instead of collapsing, book sales in the United States have soared since TV first came in. They have grown several times as fast as every indicator had predicted, whether family incomes, total popula<a id="page62" class="calibre"></a>tion in the “book-reading years,” or even people with higher degrees.</p>
<p class="para">No one knows why this happened. Indeed, no one quite knows what really happened. Books are still as rare in the typical American home as before.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote11.html" id="footnote11" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> Where, then, do all these books go? That we have no answer to this question does not alter the fact that books are being bought and paid for in increasing numbers.</p>
<p class="para">Both the publishers and the existing bookstores knew, of course, all along that book sales were soaring. Neither, however, did anything about it. The unexpected event was exploited, instead, by a few mass retailers such as department stores in Minneapolis and Los Angeles. None of these people had ever had anything to do with books, but they knew the retail business. They started bookstore chains that are quite different from any earlier bookstore in America. Basically, these are supermarkets. They do not treat books as literature but as “mass merchandise,” and they concentrate on the fast-moving items that generate the largest dollar sales per unit of shelf space. They are located in shopping centers with high rents but also with high traffic, whereas everybody in the book business had known all along that a bookstore has to be in a low-rent location, preferably near a university. Traditionally, booksellers were themselves “literary types” and tried to hire people who “love books.” The managers of the new bookstores are former cosmetics salespeople. The standing joke among them is that any salesperson who wants to read anything besides the price tag on the book is hopelessly overqualified.</p>
<p class="para">For ten years now, these new bookstore chains have been among the most successful and fastest-growing segments in American retailing and among the fastest-growing new businesses in this country altogether.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="para">Each of these cases represents genuine innovation. But not one of them represents diversification.</p>
<p class="para">IBM stayed in the computer business. And the chain bookstores are run by people who all along have been in retailing, in shopping centers, or managing “boutiques.”</p>
<p class="para">It is a condition of success in exploiting the unexpected outside event that it must fit the knowledge and expertise of one’s own business. Companies, even large companies, that went into the new book market <a id="page63" class="calibre"></a>or into mass merchandising without the retail expertise have uniformly come to grief.</p>
<p class="para">The unexpected outside event may thus be, above all, an opportunity to apply already existing expertise to a new application, but to an application that does not change the nature of the “business we are in.” It may be extension rather than diversification. Yet as the above examples show, it also demands innovation in product and often in service and distribution channels.</p>
<p class="para">The second point about these cases is that they all are big-company cases. Of course, a good many of the cases in this book, as in any management book, have to be big-company cases. They are the only available ones, as a rule, the only ones that can be found in the published records, the only ones discussed on the business page of newspapers or in magazines. Small-company cases are much harder to come by and often cannot be discussed without violating confidences.</p>
<p class="para">But exploiting the unexpected outside event appears to be something that particularly fits the existing enterprise, and a fairly sizable one at that. I know of few small companies that have successfully exploited the unexpected outside event; nor does any other student of entrepreneurship and innovation whom I could consult. This may be coincidence. But perhaps the existing large enterprise is more likely to see the “big picture.”</p>
<p class="para">It is the large retailer in the United States who is used to looking at figures that show where and how consumers spend retail dollars. The large retailer also knows about shopping-center locations and how to get the good ones. And could a small company have done what IBM did and detach four task forces of first-rate designers and engineers to work on new product lines? Smaller high-tech companies in a rapidly growing industry usually do not have enough of such people even for their existing work.</p>
<p class="para">It may well be that the unexpected outside event is the innovative area that offers the large enterprise the greatest opportunity along with the lowest risk. It may be the area that is particularly suited for innovation by the large and established enterprise. It may be the area in which expertise matters the most, and in which the ability to mobilize substantial resources fast makes the greatest difference.</p>
<p class="para">But as these cases also show, being big and established does not guarantee that an enterprise will perceive the unexpected event and successfully organize itself to exploit it. IBM’s American competitors <a id="page64" class="calibre"></a>are all big businesses with sales in the billions. Not one of them exploited the personal computer—they were all too busy fighting IBM. And not one of the old large bookstore chains in the United States, Brentano’s in New York, for instance, exploited the new book market.</p>
<p class="para">The opportunity is there, in other words. It is a major opportunity, occurring frequently. And when it occurs, it holds out great promise, particularly for existing and sizable enterprises. But such opportunities require more than mere luck or intuition. They demand that the enterprise search for innovation, be organized for it, and be managed so as to exploit it.</p>
