<div class="contents">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">An incongruity is a discrepancy, a dissonance, between what is and what “ought” to be, or between what is and what everybody assumes it to be. We may not understand the reason for it; indeed, we often cannot figure it out. Still, an incongruity is a symptom of an opportunity to innovate. It bespeaks an underlying “fault,” to use the geologist’s term. Such a fault is an invitation to innovate. It creates an instability in which quite minor efforts can move large masses and bring about a restructuring of the economic or social configuration. Incongruities do not, however, usually manifest themselves in the figures or reports executives receive and pay attention to. They are qualitative rather than quantitative.</p>
<p class="para">Like the unexpected event, whether success or failure, incongruity is a symptom of change, either change that has already occurred or change that can be made to happen. Like the changes that underlie the unexpected event, the changes that underlie incongruity are changes <span class="italic">within</span> an industry, a market, a process. The incongruity is thus clearly visible to the people within or close to the industry, market, or process; it is directly in front of their eyes. Yet it is often overlooked by the insiders, who tend to take it for granted—” This is the way it’s always been,” they say, even though “always” may be a very recent development.</p>
<p class="para">There are several kinds of incongruity:</p>
<ul class="unOrderedList">
<li class="listItem">— An incongruity between the economic realities of an industry (or of a public-service area);</li>
<li class="listItem">— An incongruity between the reality of an industry (or of a public-service area) and the assumptions about it;</li>
<li class="listItem">— An incongruity between the efforts of an industry (or a public-<a id="page66" class="calibre"></a>service area) and the values and expectations of its customers;</li>
<li class="listItem">— An internal incongruity within the rhythm or the logic of a process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="chapterHeadA">I</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">INCONGRUOUS ECONOMIC REALITIES</span></p>
<p class="para">If the demand for a product or a service is growing steadily, its economic performance should steadily improve, too. It should be easy to be profitable in an industry with steadily rising demand. The tide carries it. A lack of profitability and results in such an industry bespeaks an incongruity between economic realities.</p>
<p class="para">Typically, these incongruities are macro-phenomena, which occur within a whole industry or a whole service sector. The major opportunities for innovation exist, however, normally for the small and highly focused new enterprise, new process, or new service. And usually the innovator who exploits this incongruity can count on being left alone for a long time before the existing businesses or suppliers wake up to the fact that they have new and dangerous competition. For they are so busy trying to bridge the gap between rising demand and lagging results that they barely even notice somebody is doing something different—something that produces results, that exploits the rising demand.</p>
<p class="para">Sometimes we understand what is going on. But sometimes it is impossible to figure out why rising demand does not result in better performance. The innovator, therefore, need not always try to understand why things do not work as they should. He should ask instead: “What would exploit this incongruity? What would convert it into an opportunity? What can be done?” Incongruity between economic realities is a call to action. Sometimes the action to be taken is rather obvious, even though the problem itself is quite obscure. And sometimes we understand the problem thoroughly and yet cannot figure out what to do about it.</p>
<p class="para">The steel “mini-mill” is a good example of an innovation that successfully exploited incongruity.</p>
<p class="para">For more than fifty years, since the end of World War I, the large, integrated steel mill in developed countries did well only in wartime. In times of peace its results were consistently disappointing, even <a id="page67" class="calibre"></a>though the demand for steel appeared to be going up steadily, at least until 1973.</p>
<p class="para">The explanation of this incongruity has long been known. The minimum incremental unit needed to satisfy additional demand in an integrated steel mill is a very big investment and adds substantially to capacity. Any expansion to an existing steel mill is thus likely to operate for a good many years at a low utilization rate, until demand—which always goes up in small, incremental steps except in wartime—reaches the new capacity level. But not to expand when demand creeps up means losing market share, and permanently. No company can afford to take that risk. The industry can therefore only be profitable for a few short years: between the time when everybody begins to build new capacity and the time when all this new capacity comes on stream.</p>
<p class="para">Further, the steelmaking process invented in the 1870s is fundamentally uneconomical, as also has been known for many years. It tries to defy the laws of physics—and that means violating the laws of economics. Nothing in physics requires as much work as the creation of temperatures, whether hot or cold, unless it is working against the laws of gravity and of inertia. The integrated steel process creates very high temperatures four times, only to quench them again. And it lifts heavy masses of hot materials and then moves them over considerable distances.</p>
<p class="para">It had been clear for many years that the first innovation in process that would assuage these inherent weaknesses would substantially lower costs. This is exactly what the “mini-mill” does. A mini-mill is not a “small” plant; the minimum economical size produces around $100 million of sales. But that is still about one-sixth to one-tenth the minimum economic size of an integrated steel mill. A mini-mill can thus be built to provide, economically, a fairly small additional increment of steel production for which the market already exists. The mini-mill creates heat only once, and does not quench it, but uses it for the rest of the process. It starts with steel scrap instead of iron ore, and then concentrates on one end product: sheet, for instance, or beams, or rods. And while the integrated steel mill is highly labor-intensive, the mini-mill can be automated. Its costs thus come to less than half those of the traditional steel process.</p>
<p class="para">Governments, labor unions, and the integrated steel companies have been fighting the mini-mill every step of the way. But it is steadily <a id="page68" class="calibre"></a>encroaching. By the year 2000, fifty percent or more of the steel used in the United States is likely to come out of mini-mills, while the large, integrated steel mills will be in irreversible decline.</p>
<p class="para">There is a catch, however, and it is an important one. A similar incongruity between the economic reality of demand and the economic reality of the process exists in the paper industry. Only in this case, we do not know how to convert it into innovation and opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">Despite the constant efforts of the governments of all developed and most developing countries to increase the demand for paper—perhaps the only objective on which the governments of all countries agree—the paper industry has not been doing well. Three years of “record profits” are invariably followed by five years of “excess capacity” and losses. Yet we do not, so far, have anything like a “mini-mill” process for paper. For eighty or ninety years, it has been known that wood fiber is a monomer; and it should not be too difficult, one would say, to find a plasticizer that converts it into a polymer. This would convert paper-making from an inherently inefficient and wasteful mechanical process into an inherently efficient chemical process. Indeed, almost a hundred years ago this was achieved as far as making textile fibers out of wood pulp is concerned—in the rayon process, which dates back to the 1880s. But despite millions spent in research, nobody has so far found a technique to produce paper that way.</p>
<p class="para">In an incongruity, as these cases exemplify, the innovative solution has to be clearly definable. It has to be feasible with the existing, known technology, and with easily available resources. It requires hard developmental work, of course. But if a great deal of research and new knowledge is still needed, it is not yet ready for the entrepreneur, not yet “ripe.” The innovation that successfully exploits an incongruity between economic realities has to be simple rather than complicated, “obvious” rather than grandiose.</p>
<p class="para">In public-service areas, too, major incongruities between economic realities can be found.</p>
<p class="para">Health care in developed countries offers one example. As recently as 1929, health care represented an insignificant portion of national expenditure in all developed countries, taking up a good deal less than 1 percent of gross national product or of consumer expenditures. Now, half a century later, health care, and especially the hospital, accounts in all developed countries for 7 to 11 percent of a much larger gross national product. Yet economic performance has been going down <a id="page69" class="calibre"></a>rather than up. Costs have risen much faster than services—perhaps three or four times as fast. The demand will continue to rise with the steady growth in the number of older people in all developed countries over the next thirty years. And so will the costs, which are closely tied to the age of the population.</p>
<p class="para">We do not understand the phenomenon.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote12.html" id="footnote12" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> But successful innovations, simple, targeted and focused on specific objectives, have emerged in Great Britain and the United States. These innovations are quite different simply because the two countries have such radically different systems. But each exploits the specific vulnerability of its country’s system and converts it into an opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">In Britain, the “radical innovation” is private health insurance, which has become the fastest-growing and most popular employee benefit. All it does is to enable policyholders to be seen immediately by a specialist and to jump to the head of the queue and avoid having to wait should they need “elective surgery.”<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote13.html" id="footnote13" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">†</sup></a></span> For the British system has attempted to keep health-care costs down by <span class="italic">“triage”</span> which, in effect, reserves immediate attention and treatment to routine illnesses on the one hand and to “life-threatening” ailments on the other, but puts everything else, and especially elective surgery, on hold with waiting periods now running into years (e.g., for replacing a hip destroyed by arthritis). Health insurance policyholders, however, are operated on right away.</p>
<p class="para">In contrast to Great Britain, the United States has so far tried to satisfy all demands of health care regardless of cost. As a result, hospital costs in America have exploded. This created a different innovative opportunity: to “unbundle,” that is, to move out of the hospital into separate locations a host of services that do not require such high-cost hospital facilities as a body scanner or cobalt X-Ray to treat cancers, the highly instrumented and automated medical laboratory, or physical rehabilitation. Each of these innovative responses is small and specific: a freestanding maternity center, which basically offers motel facilities for mother and new baby; a freestanding “ambulatory” surgical center for surgery that does not require a hospital stay and post-operative care; <a id="page70" class="calibre"></a>a psychiatric diagnostic and referral center; geriatric centers of a similar nature; and so on.</p>
<p class="para">These new facilities do not substitute for the hospital. What they do in effect is to push the American hospital toward the same role the British have assigned to their hospitals: as a place for emergencies, for life-threatening diseases, and for intensive and acute sickness care. But these innovations which, as in Britain, are embodied primarily in profit-making “businesses,” convert the incongruity between the economic reality of rising health-care demand and the economic reality of falling health-care performance into an opportunity for innovation.</p>
<p class="para">These are “big” examples, taken from major industries and public services. It is this fact, however, that makes them accessible, visible, and understandable. Above all, these examples show why the incongruity between economic realities offers such great innovative opportunities. The people who work within these industries or public services know that there are basic flaws. But they are almost forced to ignore them and to concentrate instead on patching here, improving there, fighting this fire or caulking that crack. They are thus unable to take the innovation seriously, let alone to try to compete with it. They do not, as a rule, even notice it until it has grown so big as to encroach on their industry or service, by which time it has become irreversible. In the meantime, the innovators have the field to themselves.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">II</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE INCONGRUITY BETWEEN REALITY AND THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT IT</span></p>
<p class="para">Whenever the people in an industry or a service misconceive reality, whenever they therefore make erroneous assumptions about it, their efforts will be misdirected. They will concentrate on the area where results do not exist. Then there is an incongruity between reality and behavior, an incongruity that once again offers opportunity for successful innovation to whoever can perceive and exploit it.</p>
<p class="para">A simple example is that old workhorse of world trade, the ocean-going general cargo vessel.</p>
<p class="para">Thirty-five years ago, in the early 1950s, the ocean-going freighter was believed to be dying. The general forecast was that it would be <a id="page71" class="calibre"></a>replaced by air freight, except for bulk commodities. Costs of ocean freight were rising at a fast clip, and it took longer and longer to get merchandise delivered by freighter as one port after another became badly congested. This, in turn, increased pilferage at the docks as more and more merchandise piled up waiting to be loaded while vessels could not make it to the pier.</p>
<p class="para">The basic reason was that the shipping industry had misdirected its efforts toward nonresults for many years. It had tried to design and build faster ships, and ships that required less fuel and a smaller crew. It concentrated on the economics of the ship while at sea and in transit from one port to another.</p>
<p class="para">But a ship is capital equipment; and for all capital equipment the biggest cost is the cost of not working, during which interest has to be paid while the equipment does not earn. Everybody in the industry knew, of course, that the main expense of a ship is interest on the investment. Yet the industry kept on concentrating its efforts on costs that were already quite low—the costs of the ship while at sea and doing work.</p>
<p class="para">The solution was simple: Uncouple loading from stowing. Do the loading on land, where there is ample space and where it can be performed before the ship is in port, so that all that has to be done is to put on and take off pre-loaded freight. Concentrate, in other words, on the costs of not working rather than on those of working. The answer was the roll-on, roll-off ship and the container ship.</p>
<p class="para">The results of these simple innovations have been startling. Freighter traffic in the last thirty years has increased up to fivefold. Costs, overall, are down by 60 percent. Port time has been cut by three-quarters in many cases, and with it congestion and pilferage.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="para">Incongruity between perceived reality and actual reality often declares itself. But whenever serious, concentrated efforts do not make things better but, on the contrary, make things worse—where faster ships only mean more port congestion and longer delivery times—it is highly probable that efforts are being misdirected. In all likelihood, refocusing on where the results are will yield substantial returns easily and fast.</p>
<p class="para">Indeed, the incongruity between perceived and actual reality rarely requires “heroic” innovations. Uncoupling the loading of freight from the stowing thereof required little but adapting to the ocean-going <a id="page72" class="calibre"></a>freighter methods which, much earlier, had been developed for trucks and railroads.</p>
<p class="para">The incongruity between perceived and actual reality typically characterizes a whole industry or a whole service area. The solution, however, should again be small and simple, focused and highly specific.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">III</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE INCONGRUITY BETWEEN PERCEIVED AND ACTUAL CUSTOMER VALUES AND EXPECTATIONS</span></p>
<p class="para">In Chapter 3, I mentioned the case of television in Japan as an example of the unexpected success. It is also a good example of the incongruity between actual and perceived customer values and customer expectations. Long before the Japanese industrialist told his American audience that the poor in his country would not buy a TV set because they could not afford it, the poor in the United States and in Europe had already shown that TV satisfies expectations which have little to do with traditional economics. But this highly intelligent Japanese simply could not conceive that for customers—and especially for poor customers—the TV set is not just a “thing.” It represents access to a new world; access, perhaps, to a whole new life.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, Khrushchev could not conceive that the automobile is not a “thing” when he said on his visit to the United States in 1956 that “Russians will never want to own automobiles; cheap taxis make much more sense.” Any teenager could have told him that “wheels” are not mere transportation but freedom, mobility, power, romance. And Khrushchev’s misperception created one of the wildest entrepreneurial opportunities: the shortage of automobiles in Russia has brought forth the biggest and liveliest black market.</p>
<p class="para">These, it will be said, are again “cosmic” examples, not much use to a businessman or to an executive in a hospital, a university, or a trade association. But they are examples of a common phenomenon. What follows is a different case, in its own way equally “cosmic” but very definitely of operational significance.</p>
<p class="para">One of the fastest-growing American financial institutions for the last several years has been a securities firm located not in New York but in a suburb of a Midwestern city. It now has two thousand branch offices <a id="page73" class="calibre"></a>all over the United States. And it owes its success and growth to having exploited an incongruity.</p>
<p class="para">The large financial institutions, the Merrill Lynches and Dean Witters and E. F. Huttons, assume that their customers have the same values they have. To them it is obvious, <span class="italic">if</span> not axiomatic, that people invest in order to get rich. This is, after all, what motivates the members of the New York Stock Exchange, and determines what they consider “success.” However, this assumption holds true only for a part of the investing public, and surely not even for the majority. They are not “financial people.” They know that in order to “get rich” by investing, one has to work full time at managing money and be pretty knowledgeable about it. The local professional men, the local small businessmen, the local substantial farmers, however, have neither such time nor such knowledge; they are much too busy earning their money to have time to manage it.</p>
<p class="para">This is the incongruity which the Midwestern securities firm exploits. Outwardly, it looks just like any other securities firm. It is a member of the New York Stock Exchange. But only a very small portion of its business, around one-eighth, is Stock Exchange business. It stays away from the items the big trading houses on Wall Street push the hardest: options, commodity futures, and so on, appealing instead to what it calls “the intelligent investor.” It does not promise—and this is a genuine innovation among American financial service institutions—that its customers will make a fortune. It does not even want customers who trade. It wants customers who earn more money than they spend, which is typical for the successful professional, the substantial farmer, or the small-town businessman, less because their incomes are high than because their spending habits are modest. And then it appeals to their psychological need to protect their money. What this firm sells is a chance to maintain one’s savings—through investment in bonds and stocks, to be sure, but also in deferred annuities, tax-sheltered partnerships, real estate trust, and so on. The “product” the firm delivers is a different one and one that no Wall Street house has ever sold before: peace of mind. And this is what really represents “value” for the “intelligent investor.”</p>
<p class="para">The big Wall Street houses cannot even imagine that such customers exist since they defy everything the houses believe in and hold true. This successful firm has now been widely publicized. It is on every list of large and growing Stock Exchange firms. Yet the senior people in the <a id="page74" class="calibre"></a>big firms have not yet accepted that their competitor exists, let alone that it is successful.</p>
<p class="para">Behind the incongruity between actual and perceived reality, there always lies an element of intellectual arrogance, of intellectual rigor and dogmatism. “It is I, not they, who know what poor people can afford,” the Japanese industrialist in effect asserted. “People behave according to economic rationality, as every good Marxist knows,” as Khrushchev implied. This explains why the incongruity is so easily exploited by innovators: they are left alone and undisturbed.</p>
<p class="para">Of all incongruities, that between perceived and actual reality may be the most common. Producers and suppliers almost always misconceive what it is the customer actually buys. They must assume that what represents “value” to the producer and supplier is equally “value” to the customer. To succeed in doing a job, any job, one has to believe in it and take it seriously. People who make cosmetics must believe in them; otherwise, they turn out shoddy products and soon lose their customers. People who run a hospital must believe in health care as an absolute good, or the quality of medical and patient care will deteriorate fast. And yet, no customer ever perceives himself as buying what the producer or supplier delivers. Their expectations and values are always different.</p>
<p class="para">The reaction of the typical producer and supplier is then to complain that customers are “irrational” or “unwilling to pay for quality.” Whenever such a complaint is heard, there is reason to assume that the values and expectations the producer or supplier holds to be real are incongruous with the actual values and expectations of customers and clients. Then there is reason to look for an opportunity for innovation that is highly specific, and carries a good chance of success.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">IV</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">INCONGRUITY WITHIN THE RHYTHM OR LOGIC OF A PROCESS</span></p>
<p class="para">Twenty-five years or so ago, during the late 1950s, a pharmaceutical company salesman decided that he wanted to go into business for himself. He therefore looked for an incongruity within a process in medical practice. He found one almost immediately. One of the most common surgical operations is the operation for senile cataract in the eye. Over <a id="page75" class="calibre"></a>the years the procedure had become refined, routinized and instrumented to the point where it was conducted with the rhythm of a perfectly rehearsed dance—and with total control. But there was one point in this operation that was out of character and out of rhythm: at one phase the eye surgeon had to cut a ligament, to tie blood vessels and so risk bleeding, which then endangered the eye. This procedure was done successfully in more than 99 percent of all operations; indeed, it was not very difficult. But it greatly bothered the surgeons. It forced them to change their rhythm and induced anxiety in them. Eye surgeons, no matter how often they had done the operation, dreaded this one, quick procedure.</p>
<p class="para">The pharmaceutical company salesman—his name is William Connor—found out without much research that an enzyme had been isolated in the 1890s which almost instantaneously dissolves this particular ligament. Only nobody then, sixty years earlier, had been able to store this enzyme even under refrigeration for more than a few short hours. Preservation techniques have, however, made quite a bit of progress since 1890. And so Connor, within a few months, was able by trial and error to find a preservative that gives the enzyme substantial shelf life without destroying its potency. Within a few years, every eye surgeon in the world was using Connor’s patented compound. Twenty years later he sold his company, Alcon Laboratories, to one of the multinationals for a very large amount.</p>
<p class="para">And another telling example:</p>
<p class="para">O. M. Scott &amp; Co. is the leader among American producers of lawn-care products: grass seed, fertilizer, pesticides, and so on. Though it is now a subsidiary of a large corporation (ITT), it attained leadership while a small independent company in fierce competition with firms many times its size, ranging from Sears, Roebuck to Dow Chemicals. Its products are good but so are those of the competition. Its leadership rests on a simple, mechanical gadget called a Spreader, a small, lightweight wheelbarrow with holes that can be set to allow the proper quantities of Scott’s products to pass through in an even flow. Products for the lawn all claim to be “scientific” and are compounded on the basis of extensive tests. All prescribe in meticulous detail how much of the stuff should be applied, given soil conditions and temperatures. All try to convey to the consumer that growing a lawn is “precise,” “controlled,” if not “scientific.” But before the Scott Spreader, no supplier of lawn-care products gave the customer a tool to control the process.</p>
<a id="page76" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">And without such a tool, there was an internal incongruity in the logic of the process that upset and frustrated customers.</p>
<p class="para">Does the identification of such internal incongruity within a process rest on “intuition” and on accident? Or can it be organized and systematized?</p>
<p class="para">William Connor is said to have started out by asking surgeons where they felt uncomfortable about their work. O. M. Scott grew from a tiny local seed retailer into a fair-sized national company because it asked dealers and customers what they missed in available products. Then it designed its product line around the Spreader.</p>
<p class="para">The incongruity within a process, its rhythm or its logic, is not a very subtle matter. Users are always aware of it. Every eye surgeon knew about the discomfort he felt when he had to cut eye muscle—and talked about it. Every hardware-store clerk knew about the frustration of his lawn customers—and talked about it. What was lacking, however, was someone willing to listen, somebody who took seriously what everybody proclaims: That the purpose of a product or a service is to satisfy the customer. If this axiom is accepted and acted upon, using incongruity as an opportunity for innovation becomes fairly easy—and highly effective.</p>
<p class="para">There is, however, one serious limitation. The incongruity is usually available only to people within a given industry or service. It is not something that somebody from the outside is likely to spot, to understand, and hence is able to exploit.</p>
