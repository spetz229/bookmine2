<p class="chapterOpenerText">The unexpected; incongruities; changes in market and industry structure; and process needs—the sources of innovative opportunity discussed so far in Chapters 3 through 6—manifest themselves within a business, an industry, or a market. They may actually be symptoms of changes outside, in the economy, in society, and in knowledge. But they show up internally.</p>
<p class="para">The remaining sources of innovative opportunity:</p>
<ul class="unOrderedList">
<li class="listItem">— Demographics;</li>
<li class="listItem">— Changes in perception, meaning, and mood;</li>
<li class="listItem">— New knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">are external. They are changes in the social, philosophical, political, and intellectual environment.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">I</p>
<p class="para">Of all external changes, demographics—defined as changes in population, its size, age structure, composition, employment, educational status, and income—are the clearest. They are unambiguous. They have the most predictable consequences.</p>
<p class="para">They also have known and almost certain lead times. Anyone in the American labor force in the year 2000 is alive by now (though not necessarily living in the United States; a good many of America’s workers fifteen years hence may now be children in a Mexican <span class="italic">pueblo,</span> for example). All people reaching retirement age in 2030 in the developed countries are already in the labor force, and in most cases in the occupational group in which they will stay until they retire or die. And the educational attainment of the people now in their early or mid-twenties will largely determine their career paths for another forty years.</p>
<a id="page97" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">Demographics have major impact on what will be bought, by whom, and in what quantities. American teenagers, for instance, buy a good many pairs of cheap shoes a year; they buy for fashion, not durability, and their purses are limited. The same people, ten years later, will buy very few pairs of shoes a year—a sixth as many as they bought when they were seventeen—but they will buy them for comfort and durability first and for fashion second. People in their sixties and seventies in the developed countries—that is, people in their early retirement years—form the prime travel and vacation market. Ten years later the same people are customers for retirement communities, nursing homes, and extended (and expensive) medical care. Two-earner families have more money than they have time, and spend accordingly. People who have acquired extensive schooling in their younger years, especially professional or technical schooling, will, ten to twenty years later, become customers for advanced professional training.</p>
<p class="para">But people with extensive schooling are also available primarily for employment as knowledge workers. Even without competition from low-wage countries with tremendous surpluses of young people trained only for unskilled or semi-skilled manual jobs—the surge of young people in the Third World countries resulting from the drop in infant mortality after 1955—the industrially developed countries of the West and of Japan would have had to automate. Demographics alone, the combined effects of the sharp drop in birth rates and of the “educational explosion”—makes it near-certain that traditional manual blue-collar employment in manufacturing in developed countries, by the year 2010, cannot be more than one-third or less than what it was in 1970. (Though manufacturing production, as a result of automation, may be three to four times what it was then.)</p>
<p class="para">All this <span class="italic">is</span> so obvious that no one, one should think, needs to be reminded of the importance of demographics. And indeed businessmen, economists, and politicians have always acknowledged the critical importance of population trends, movements, and dynamics. But they also believed that they did not have to pay attention to demographics in their day-to-day decisions. Population changes—whether in birth rates or mortality rates, in educational attainment, in labor force composition and participation, or in the location and movement of people—were thought to occur so slowly and over such long time spans as to be of little practical concern. Great demographic catastrophes such as the Black Death in Europe in the fourteenth century were admitted to <a id="page98" class="calibre"></a>have immediate impacts on society and economy. But otherwise, demographic changes were “secular” changes, of interest to the historian and the statistician rather than to the businessman or the administrator.</p>
<p class="para">This was always a dangerous error. The massive nineteenth-century migration from Europe to the Americas, both North and South, and to Australia and New Zealand, changed the economic and political geography of the world beyond recognition. It created an abundance of entrepreneurial opportunities. It made obsolete the geopolitical concepts on which European politics and military strategies had been based for several centuries. Yet it took place in a mere <span class="italic">fifty</span> years, from the mid-1860s to 1914. Whoever disregarded it was likely to be left behind, and fast.</p>
<p class="para">Until 1860, for instance, the House of Rothschild was the world’s dominant financial power. The Rothschilds failed, however, to recognize the meaning of the transatlantic migration; only “riff-raff,” they thought, would leave Europe. As a result, the Rothschilds ceased to be important around 1870. They had become merely rich individuals. It was J. P. Morgan who took over. His “secret” was to spot the transatlantic migration at its very onset, to understand immediately its significance, and to exploit it as an opportunity by establishing a worldwide bank in New York rather than in Europe, and as the medium for financing the American industries that immigrant labor was making possible. It also took only thirty years, from 1830 to 1860, to transform both western Europe and the eastern United States from rural and farm-based societies into industry-dominated big-city civilizations.</p>
<p class="para">Demographic changes tended to be just as fast, just as abrupt, and to have fully as much impact, in earlier times. The belief that populations changed slowly in times past is pure myth. Or rather, static populations staying in one place for long periods of time have been the exception historically rather than the rule.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote14.html" id="footnote14" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="para">In the twentieth century it is sheer folly to disregard demographics. The basic assumption for our time must be that populations are inherently unstable and subject to sudden sharp changes—and that they are the first environmental factor that a decision maker, whether businessman or politician, analyzes and thinks through. Few issues in this century, for instance, will be as critical to both domestic and international politics as the aging of the population in the developed countries on the <a id="page99" class="calibre"></a>one hand and the tidal wave of young adults in the Third World on the other hand. Whatever the reasons, twentieth-century societies, both developed and developing ones, have become prone to extremely rapid and radical demographic changes, which occur without advance warning.</p>
<p class="para">The most prominent American population experts called together by Franklin D. Roosevelt predicted unanimously in 1938 that the U.S. population would peak at around 140 million people in 1943 or 1944, and then slowly decline. The American population—with a minimum of immigration—now stands at 240 million. For in 1949, without the slightest advance warning, the United States kicked off a “baby boom” that for twelve years produced unprecedentedly large families, only to turn just as suddenly in 1960 into a “baby bust,” producing equally unprecedented small families. The demographers of 1938 were not incompetents or fools; there was just no indication then of a “baby boom.”</p>
<p class="para">Twenty years later another American President, John F. Kennedy, called together a group of eminent experts to work out his Latin-Amen-can aid and development program, the “Alliance for Progress.” Not one of the experts paid attention in 1961 to the precipitous drop in infant mortality which, within another fifteen years, totally changed Latin America’s society and economy. The experts also all assumed, without reservation, a rural Latin America. They, too, were neither incompetents nor fools. But the drop in infant mortality in Latin America and the urbanization of society had barely begun at the time.</p>
<p class="para">In 1972 and 1973, the most experienced labor force analysts in the United States still accepted without question that the participation of women would continue to decline as it had done for many years. When the “baby boomers” came on the labor market in record numbers, they worried (quite unnecessarily, as it turned out) where all the jobs for the young males would be coming from. No one asked where jobs would come from for young females—they were not supposed to need any. Ten years later the labor force participation of American women under fifty stood at 64 per cent, the highest rate ever. And there is little difference in labor force participation in this group between married and unmarried women, or between women with and without children.</p>
<p class="para">These shifts are not only dazzlingly sudden. They are often mysterious and defy explanation. The drop in infant mortality in the Third World can be explained in retrospect. It was caused by a convergence <a id="page100" class="calibre"></a>of old technologies: the public-health nurse; placing the latrine below the well; vaccination; the wire screen outside the window; and, of very new technologies, antibiotics and pesticides such as DDT. Yet it was totally unpredictable. And what explains the “baby boom” or the “baby bust”? What explains the sudden rush of American women (and of European women as well, though with a lag of a few years) into the labor force? And what explains the rush into the slums of Latin-American cities?</p>
<p class="para">Demographic shifts in this century may be inherently unpredictable, yet they do have long lead times before impact, and lead times, moreover, which are predictable. It will be five years before newborn babies become kindergarten pupils and need classrooms, playgrounds, and teachers. It will be fifteen years before they become important as customers, and nineteen to twenty years before they join the labor force as adults. Populations in Latin America began to grow quite rapidly as soon as infant mortality began to drop. Still the babies who did not die did not become schoolchildren for five or six years, nor adolescents looking for work for fifteen or sixteen years. And it takes at least ten years—usually fifteen—before any change in educational attainments translates itself into labor force composition and available skills.</p>
<p class="para">What makes demographics such a rewarding opportunity for the entrepreneur is precisely its neglect by decision makers, whether businessmen, public-service staffs, or governmental policymakers. They still cling to the assumption that demographics do not change—or do not change fast. Indeed, they reject even the plainest evidence of demographic changes. Here are some fairly typical examples.</p>
<p class="para">By 1970, it had become crystal clear that the number of children in America’s schools was going to be 25 to 30 percent lower than it had been in the 1960s, for ten or fifteen years at least. After all, children entering kindergarten in 1970 have to be alive no later than 1965, and the “baby bust” was well established beyond possibility of rapid reversal by that year. Yet the schools of education in American universities flatly refused to accept this. They considered it a law of nature, it seems, that the number of children of school age must go up year after year. And so they stepped up their efforts to recruit students, causing substantial unemployment for graduates a few years later, severe pressure on teachers’ salaries, and massive closings of schools of education.</p>
<p class="para">And here are two examples from my own experience. In 1957, I published a forecast that there would be ten to twelve million college <a id="page101" class="calibre"></a>students in the United States twenty-five years later, that is, by the mid-seventies. The figure was derived simply by putting together two demographic events that had already happened: the increase in the number of births and the increase in the percentage of young adults going to college. The forecast was absolutely correct. Yet practically every established university pooh-poohed it. Twenty years later, in 1976, I looked at the age figures and predicted that retirement age in the United States would have to be raised to seventy or eliminated altogether within ten years. The change came even faster: compulsory retirement at any age was abolished in California a year later, in 1977, and retirement before seventy for the rest of the country two years later, in 1978. The demographic figures that made this prediction practically certain were well known and published. Yet most so-called experts—government economists, labor-union economists, business economists, statisticians—dismissed the forecast as utterly absurd. “It will never happen” was the all but unanimous response. The labor unions actually proposed at the time lowering the mandatory retirement age to sixty or below.</p>
<p class="para">This unwillingness, or inability, of the experts to accept demographic realities which do not conform to what they take for granted gives the entrepreneur his opportunity. The lead times are known. The events themselves have already happened. But no one accepts them as reality, let alone as opportunity. Those who defy the conventional wisdom and accept the facts—indeed, those who go actively looking for them—can therefore expect to be left alone for quite a long time. The competitors will accept demographic reality, as a rule, only when it is already about to be replaced by a new demographic change and a new demographic reality.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">II</p>
<p class="para">Here are some examples of successful exploitation of demographic changes.</p>
<p class="para">Most of the large American universities dismissed my forecast of 10 to 12 million college students by the 1970s as preposterous. But the entrepreneurial universities took it seriously: Pace University, in New York, was one, and Golden Gate University in San Francisco another. They were just as incredulous at first, but they checked the forecast and found that it was valid, and in fact the only rational prediction. They <a id="page102" class="calibre"></a>then organized themselves for the additional student enrollment; the traditional, and especially the “prestige” universities, on the other hand, did nothing. As a result, twenty years later these brash newcomers had the students, and when enrollments decreased nationwide as a result of the “baby bust,” they still kept on growing.</p>
<p class="para">One American retailer who accepted the “baby boom” was then a small and undistinguished shoe chain, Melville. In the early 1960s just before the first cohorts of the “baby boom” reached adolescence, Melville directed itself to this new market. It created new and different stores specifically for teenagers. It redesigned its merchandise. It advertised and promoted to the sixteen-and seventeen-year-olds. And it went beyond footwear into clothing for teenagers, both female and male. As a result, Melville became one of the fastest-growing and most profitable retailers in America. Ten years later other retailers caught on and began to cater to teenagers—just as the center of demographic gravity started to shift away from them and toward “young adults,” twenty to twenty-five years old. By then Melville was already shifting its own focus to that new dominant age cohort.</p>
<p class="para">The scholars on Latin America whom President Kennedy brought together to advise him on the Alliance for Progress in 1961 did not see Latin America’s urbanization. But one business, the American retail chain Sears, Roebuck, had seen it several years earlier—not <span class="italic">by</span> poring over statistics but by going out and looking at customers in Mexico City and Lima, São Paulo and Bogotá. As a result, Sears in the mid-fifties began to build American-type department stores in major Latin-American cities, designed for a new urban middle class which, while not “rich,” was part of the money economy and had middle-class aspirations. Sears became the leading retailer in Latin America within a few years.</p>
<p class="para">And here are two examples of exploiting demographics to innovate in building a highly productive labor force. The expansion of New York’s Citibank is largely based on its early realization of the movement of young, highly educated and highly ambitious women into the work force. Most large American employers considered these women a “problem” as late as 1980; many still do. Citibank, almost alone among large employers, saw in them an opportunity. It aggressively recruited them during the 1970s, trained them, and sent them out all over the country as lending officers. These ambitious young women very largely made Citibank into the nation’s leading, and its first truly “national” <a id="page103" class="calibre"></a>bank. At the same time, a few savings and loan associations (not an industry noted for innovation or venturing) realized that older married women who had earlier dropped out of the labor force when their children were small make high-grade employees when brought back as permanent part-time workers. “Everybody knew” that part-timers are “temporary,” and that women who have once left the labor force never come back into it; both were perfectly sensible rules in earlier times. But demographics made them obsolete. The willingness to accept this fact—and again such willingness stemmed not from reading statistics but from going out and looking—has given the savings and loan associations an exceptionally loyal, exceptionally productive work force, particularly in California.</p>
<p class="para">The success of Club Mediterranée in the travel and resort business is squarely the result of exploiting demographic changes: the emergence of large numbers of young adults in Europe and the United States who are affluent and educated but only one generation away from working-class origins. Still quite unsure of themselves, still not self-confident as tourists, they are eager to have somebody with the know-how to organize their vacations, their travel, their fun—and yet they are not really comfortable either with their working-class parents or with older, middle-class people. Thus, they are ready-made customers for a new and “exotic” version of the old teenage hangout.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">III</p>
<p class="para">Analysis of demographic changes begins with population figures. But absolute population is the least significant number. Age distribution is far more important, for instance. In the 1960s, it was the rapid increase in the number of young people in most non-Communist developed countries that proved significant (the one notable exception was Great Britain, where the “baby boom” was short-lived). In the 1980s and even more in the 1990s, it will be the drop in the number of young people, the steady increase in the number of early middle-age people (up to forty) and the very rapid increase in the number of old people (seventy and over). What opportunities do these developments offer? What are the values and the expectations, the needs and wants of these various age groups?</p>
<p class="para">The number of traditional college students cannot increase. The most one can hope for is that it will not fall, that the percentage of <a id="page104" class="calibre"></a>eighteen-and nineteen-year-olds who stay in school beyond secondary education will increase sufficiently to offset the decline in the total number. But with the increase in the number of people in their mid-thirties and forties who have received a college degree earlier, there are going to be large numbers of highly schooled people who want advanced professional training and retraining, whether as doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers, executives, or teachers. What do these people look for? What do they need? How can they pay? What does the traditional university have to do to attract and satisfy such very different students? And, finally, what are the wants, needs, values of the elderly? Is there indeed any one “older group,” or are there rather several, each with different expectations, needs, values, satisfactions?</p>
<p class="para">Particularly important in age distribution—and with the highest predictive value—are changes in the center of population gravity, that is, in the age group which at any given time constitutes both the largest and the fastest-growing age cohort in the population.</p>
<p class="para">At the end of the Eisenhower presidency, in the late fifties, the center of population gravity in the United States was at its highest point in history. But a violent shift within a few years was bound to take place. As a result of the “baby boom,” the center of American population gravity was going to drop so sharply by 1965 as to bring it to the lowest point since the early days of the Republic, to around sixteen or seventeen. It was predictable—and indeed predicted by anyone who took demographics seriously and looked at the figures—that there would be a drastic change in mood and values. The “youth rebellion” of the sixties was mainly a shift of the spotlight to what has always been typical adolescent behavior. In earlier days, with the center of population gravity in the late twenties or early thirties, age groups that are notoriously ultra-conservative, adolescent behavior was dismissed as “Boys will be boys” (and “Girls will be girls”). In the sixties it suddenly became the representative behavior.</p>
<p class="para">But when everybody was talking of a “permanent shift in values” or of a “greening of America,” the age pendulum had already swung back, and violently so. By 1969, the first effects of the “baby bust” were already discernible, and not only in the statistics. 1974 or 1975 would be the last year in which the sixteen-and seventeen-year-olds would constitute the center of population gravity. After that, the center would rapidly move up: by the early 1980s it would be in the high twenties again. And with this shift would come a change in what would be <a id="page105" class="calibre"></a>considered “representative” behavior. The teenagers would, of course, continue to behave like teenagers. But that would again be dismissed as the way teenagers behave rather than as the constitutive values and behavior of society. And so one could predict with near-certainty, for instance (and some of us did predict it), that by the mid-seventies the college campuses would cease to be “activist” and “rebellious,” and college students would again be concerned with grades and jobs; but also that the overwhelming majority of the “dropouts” of 1968 would, ten years later, have become the “upward-mobile professionals” concerned with careers, advancement, tax shelters, and stock options.</p>
<p class="para">Segmentation by educational attainment may be equally important; indeed, for some purposes, it may be more important (e.g., selling encyclopedias, continuing professional education, but also vacation travel). Then there is labor force participation and occupational segmentation. Finally there is income distribution, and especially distribution of disposable and discretionary income. What happens, for instance, to the propensity to save in the two-earner family?</p>
<p class="para">Actually, most of the answers are available. They are the stuff of market research. All that is needed is the willingness to ask the questions.</p>
<p class="para">But more than poring over statistics is involved. To be sure, statistics are the starting point. They were what got Melville to ask what opportunities the jump in teenagers offered a fashion retailer, or what got the top management at Sears, Roebuck to look upon Latin America as a potential market. But then the managements of these companies—or the administrators of metropolitan big-city universities such as Pace in New York and Golden Gate in San Francisco—went out into the field to look and listen.</p>
<p class="para">This is literally how Sears, Roebuck decided to go into Latin America. Sears’s chairman, Robert E. Wood, read in the early 1950s that Mexico City and São Paulo were expected to outgrow all U.S. cities by the year 1975. This so intrigued him that he went himself to look at the major cities in Latin America. He spent a week in each of them—Mexico City, Guadalajara, Bogota, Lima, Santiago, Rio, São Paulo—walking around, looking at stores (he was appalled by what he saw), and studying traffic patterns. Then he knew what customers to aim at, what kind of stores to build, where to put the stores, and what merchandise to stock them with.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, the founders of Club Mediterranée looked at the custom<a id="page106" class="calibre"></a>ers of package tours, talked to them and listened to them, before they built their first vacation resort. And the two young men who turned Melville Shoe from a dowdy, undistinguished shoe chain (one among many) into the fastest-growing popular fashion retailer in America similarly spent weeks and months in shopping centers, looking at customers, listening to them, exploring their values. They studied the way young people shopped, what kind of environment they liked (do teenage boys and girls, for instance, shop in the same place for shoes or do they want to have separate stores?), and what they considered “value” in the merchandise they bought.</p>
<p class="para">Thus, for those genuinely willing to go out into the field, to look and to listen, changing demographics is both a highly productive and a highly dependable innovative opportunity.</p>
