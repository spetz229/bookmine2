<div class="contents">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“Opportunity is the source of innovation” has been the leitmotif of the preceding chapters. But an old proverb says, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” This chapter looks at <span class="italic">need</span> as a source of innovation, and indeed as a major innovative opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">The need we shall discuss as a source of innovative opportunity is a very specific one: I call it “process need.” It is not vague or general but quite concrete. Like the unexpected, or the incongruities, it exists within the process of a business, an industry, or a service. Some innovations based on process need exploit incongruities, others demographics. Indeed, process need, unlike the other sources of innovation, does not start out with an event in the environment, whether internal or external. It starts out with the job to be done. It is task-focused rather than situation-focused. It perfects a process that already exists, replaces a link that is weak, redesigns an existing old process around newly available knowledge. Sometimes it makes possible a process by supplying the “missing link.”</p>
<p class="para">In innovations that are based on process need, everybody in the organization always knows that the need exists. Yet usually no one does anything about it. However, when the innovation appears, it is immediately accepted as “obvious” and soon becomes “standard.”</p>
<p class="para">One example has been mentioned earlier in Chapter 4. It is William Connor’s conversion of the enzyme that dissolves a ligament in cataract surgery of the eye from a textbook curiosity into an indispensable product. The process of cataract surgery itself was a very old one. The enzyme to perfect the process had been known for decades. The innovation was the preservative to keep the enzyme fresh under refrigeration. Once that process need had been satisfied, no eye surgeon could possibly imagine doing without Connor’s compound.</p>
<p class="para">Very few innovations based on process need are so sharply focused <a id="page78" class="calibre"></a>as this one, in which formulating the need right away produced the required solution. But in their essentials, most, if not all, innovations based on process need have the same elements.</p>
<p class="para">Here is another example of a similar process-need innovation.</p>
<p class="para">Ottmar Mergenthaler designed the linotype for typesetting in 1885. During the preceding decades, printed materials of all kinds—magazines, newspapers, books—had all been growing at an exponential rate with the spread of literacy and the development of transportation and communication. All the other elements of the printing process had already changed. There were high-speed printing presses, for instance, and paper was being made on high-speed paper machines. Only typesetting had gone unchanged from the days of Gutenberg four hundred years earlier. It remained slow and expensive manual work, requiring high skill and long years of apprenticeship. Mergenthaler, like Connor, defined what was needed: a keyboard that would make possible the mechanical selection of the right letter from the typefont; a mechanism to assemble the letters and to adjust them in a line; and—the most difficult, by the way—a mechanism to return each letter to its proper receptacle for future use. Each of these required several years of hard work and considerable ingenuity. But none required new knowledge, let alone new science. Mergenthaler’s linotype became the “standard” in less than five years, despite vigorous resistance from the old craftsmen-typesetters.</p>
<p class="para">In both these cases—William Connor’s enzyme and the linotype machine—the process need was based on an incongruity in the process. Demographics, however, are very often an equally powerful source of process need and an opportunity for process innovation.</p>
<p class="para">In 1909 or thereabouts a statistician at the Bell Telephone System projected two curves fifteen years ahead: the curve for American population growth and the curve for the number of people required as central-station operators to handle the growing volume of telephone calls. These projections showed that every American woman between age seventeen and sixty would have to work as a switchboard operator by the year 1925 or 1930 if the manual system of handling calls were to be continued. Two years later, Bell engineers had designed and put into service the first automatic switchboard.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, the present rush into robotics is largely the result of a process need caused by demographics. Most of the knowledge has been around for years. But until the consequences of the “baby bust” became <a id="page79" class="calibre"></a>apparent to major manufacturers in the industrial countries, especially in Japan and the United States, the need to replace semi-skilled assembly-line labor with machines was not felt. The Japanese are not ahead in robotics because of technical superiority; their designs have mostly come from the United States. But the Japanese had their “baby bust” four or five years earlier than America and almost ten years earlier than West Germany. It took the Japanese just as long as it did the Americans or the Germans—ten years—to realize that they were facing a labor shortage. But these ten years started in Japan a good deal sooner than in the United States, and in West Germany the ten years are still not quite over as these lines are being written.</p>
<p class="para">Mergenthaler’s linotype was also in large measure the result of demographic pressures. With the demand for printed materials exploding, the supply of typesetters requiring an apprenticeship of six to eight years was fast becoming inadequate, and wages for typesetters were skyrocketing. As a result, printers became conscious of the “weak link” but also willing to pay good money for a machine that replaced five very expensive craftsmen with one semi-skilled machine operator.</p>
<p class="para">Incongruities and demographics may be the most common causes of a process need. But there is another category, far more difficult and risky yet in many cases of even greater importance: what is now being called program research (as contrasted with the traditional “pure research” of scientists). There is a “weak link” and it is definable, indeed, clearly seen and acutely felt. But to satisfy the process need, considerable <span class="italic">new knowledge</span> has to be produced.</p>
<p class="para">Very few inventions have succeeded faster than photography. Within twenty years after its invention, it had become popular worldwide. Within twenty years or so, there were great photographers in every country; Mathew Brady’s photographs of the American Civil War are still unsurpassed. By 1860, every bride had to have her photograph taken. Photography was the first Western technology to invade Japan, well before the Meiji Restoration and at a time when Japan otherwise was still firmly closed to foreigners and foreign ideas.</p>
<p class="para">Amateur photographers were fully established by 1870. But the available technology made things difficult for them. Photography required heavy and fragile glass plates, which had to be lugged around and treated with extreme care. It required an equally heavy camera, long preparations before a picture could be taken, elaborate settings, and so on. Everybody knew this. Indeed, the photography magazines <a id="page80" class="calibre"></a>of the time—and photography magazines were among the first specialty mass magazines—are full of complaints about the extreme difficulty of taking photographs and of suggestions what to do. But the problems could not be solved with the science and technology available in 1870.</p>
<p class="para">By the mid-1880s, however, new knowledge had become available which then enabled George Eastman, the founder of Kodak, to replace the heavy glass plates with a cellulose film weighing practically nothing and impervious even to very rough handling, and to design a lightweight camera around his film. Within ten years, Eastman Kodak had taken world leadership in photography, which it still retains.</p>
<p class="para">“Program research” is often needed to convert a process from potential into reality. Again, the need must be felt, and it must be possible to identify what is needed. Then the new knowledge has to be produced. The prototype innovator for this kind of process-need innovation was Edison (see also Chapter 9). For twenty-odd years, everybody had known that there was going to be an “electric power industry.” For the last five or six years of that period, it had become abundantly clear what the “missing link” was: the light bulb. Without it, there could be no electric power industry. Edison defined the new knowledge needed to convert this potential electric power industry into an actual one, went to work, and had a light bulb within two years.</p>
<p class="para">Program research to convert a potential into reality has become the central methodology of the first-rate industrial research laboratory and, of course, of research for defense, for agriculture, for medicine, and for environmental protection.</p>
<p class="para">Program research sounds big. To many people it means “putting a man on the moon” or finding a vaccine against polio. But its most successful applications are in small and clearly defined projects-the smaller and the more sharply focused the better. Indeed, the best example—and perhaps the best single example of successful process need—based innovation—is a very small one, the highway reflector that cut the Japanese automobile accident rate by almost two-thirds.</p>
<p class="para">As late as 1965, Japan had almost no paved roads outside of the big cities. But the country was rapidly shifting to the automobile, so the government frantically paved the roads. Now automobiles could—and did—travel at high speed. But the roads were the same old ones that had been laid down by the oxcarts of the tenth century—barely wide enough for two cars to pass, full of blind corners and hidden entrances, <a id="page81" class="calibre"></a>and with junctions every few kilometers at which half a dozen roads meet at every conceivable angle. Accidents began to mount at an alarming rate, especially at night. Press, radio and TV, and the opposition parties in Parliament soon began to clamor for the government to “do something.” But, of course, rebuilding the roads was out of the question; it would have taken twenty years anyhow. And a massive publicity campaign to make automobilists “drive carefully” had the result such campaigns generally have, namely, none at all.</p>
<p class="para">A young Japanese, Tamon Iwasa, seized on this crisis as an innovative opportunity. He redesigned the traditional highway reflector so that the little glass beads that serve as its mirrors could be adjusted to reflect the headlights of oncoming cars from any direction onto any direction. The government rushed to install Iwasa reflectors by the hundreds of thousands. And the accident rate plummeted.</p>
<p class="para">To take another example.</p>
<p class="para">World War I had created a public in the United States for national and international news. Everybody was aware of this. Indeed, the newspapers and magazines of those early post—World War I years are full of discussions as to how this need could be satisfied. But the local newspaper could not do the job. Several leading publishers tried, among them <span class="italic">The New York Times;</span> none of them succeeded. Then Henry Luce identified the process need and defined what was required to satisfy it. It could not be a local publication, it had to be a national one, otherwise, there would be neither enough readers nor enough advertisers. And it could not be a daily—there was not enough news of interest to a large public. The development of the editorial format was then practically dictated by these specifications. When <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine came out as the first news magazine in the world, it was an immediate success.</p>
<p class="para">These examples, and especially the Iwasa story, show that successful innovations based on process needs require five basic criteria:</p>
<ul class="unOrderedList">
<li class="listItem">— A self-contained process;</li>
<li class="listItem">— One “weak” or “missing” link;</li>
<li class="listItem">— A clear definition of the objective;</li>
<li class="listItem">— That the specifications for the solution can be defined clearly;</li>
<li class="listItem">— Widespread realization that “there ought to be a better way,” that is, high receptivity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">There are, however, some important caveats.</p> 
<p class="para">1. The need must be <span class="italic">understood.</span> It is not enough for it to be <a id="page82" class="calibre"></a>“felt.” Otherwise one cannot define the specifications for the solution.</p>
<p class="para">We have known, for instance, for several hundred years that mathematics is a problem subject in school. A small minority of students, certainly no more than one-fifth, seem to have no difficulty with mathematics and learn it easily. The rest never really learn it. It is possible, of course, to drill a very much larger percentage to pass mathematics tests. The Japanese do this through heavy emphasis on the subject. But that does not mean that Japanese children learn mathematics. They learn to pass the tests and then immediately forget mathematics. Ten years later, by the time they are in their late twenties, Japanese do just as poorly on mathematics tests as do westerners. In every generation there is a mathematics teacher of genius who somehow can make even the untalented learn, or at least learn a good deal better. But nobody has ever been able, then, to replicate what this one person does. The need is acutely felt, but we do not understand the problem. Is it a lack of native ability? Is it that we are using the wrong methods? Are there psychological and emotional problems? No one knows the answer. And without understanding the problem, we have not been able to find any solution.</p>
<p class="para">2. We may even understand a process and still not have the knowledge to do the job. The preceding chapter told of the clear and understood incongruity in paper making: to find a process that is less wasteful and less uneconomical than the existing one. For a century, able people have worked on the problem. We know exactly what is needed: polymerization of the lignin molecule. It should be easy—we have polymerized many molecules that are similar. But we lack the knowledge to do it, despite a hundred years of assiduous work by well-trained people. One can only say, “Let’s try something else.”</p>
<p class="para">3. The solution must fit the way people do the work and want to do it. Amateur photographers had no psychological investment in the complicated technology of the early photographic process. All they wanted was to get a decent photograph, as easily as possible. They were receptive, therefore, to a process that took the labor and skill out of taking pictures. Similarly, eye surgeons were interested only in an elegant, logical, bloodless process. An enzyme that gave this to them therefore satisfied their expectations and values.</p>
<p class="para">But here is an example of an innovation based on a clear and substantial process need that apparently does not quite fit, and therefore has not been readily accepted.</p>
<a id="page83" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">For many years the information required by a number of professionals such as lawyers, accountants, engineers, and physicians has grown much faster than the capacity to find it. Professionals have been complaining that they have to spend more and more time hunting for information in the law library, in handbooks and textbooks, in looseleaf services, and so on. One would therefore expect a “databank” to be an immediate success. It gives the professionals immediate information through a computer program and a display terminal: court decisions for the lawyers, tax rulings for the accountants, information on drugs and poisons for the physicians. Yet these services have found it very hard to gather enough subscribers to break even. In some cases, such as Lexis, a service for lawyers, it has taken more than ten years and huge sums of money to get subscribers. The reason is probably that the databanks make it <span class="italic">too</span> easy. Professionals pride themselves on their “memory,” that is, on their ability either to remember the information they need or to know where to find it. “You have to remember the court decisions you need and where to find them,” is still the injunction the beginning lawyer gets from the seniors. So the databank, however helpful in the work and however much time and money it saves, goes against the very values of the professional. “What would you need <span class="italic">me</span> for if it can be looked up?” an eminent physician once said when asked by one of his patients why he did not use the service that would give him the information to check and confirm his diagnosis, and then decide which alternative method of treatment might be the best in a given case.</p>
<p class="para">Opportunities for innovation based on process need can be found systematically. This is what Edison did for electricity and electronics. This is what Henry Luce did while still an undergraduate at Yale. This is what William Connor did. In fact, the area lends itself to systematic search and analysis.</p>
<p class="para">But once a process need has been found, it has to be tested against the five basic criteria given above. Then, finally, the process need opportunity has to be tested also against the three constraints. Do we understand what is needed? Is the knowledge available or can it be procured within the “state of the art”? And does the solution fit, or does it violate the mores and values of the intended users?</p>
