    CoffeeScript is a young language. But from the start, it’s drawn an exceptionally diverse and spirited crowd. That wonderful energy—on IRC, GitHub, Hacker News, blogs, Twitter, and elsewhere—is what inspired me to write this book. To everyone who greeted CoffeeScript with enthusiasm in its infancy, I thank you.
  </p>
<p id="N100D5" class="calibre5">
    Thanks, of course, to Jeremy Ashkenas for creating the language and contributing a generous foreword to this book; CoffeeScript could not have asked for a better BDFL. Thanks also to CoffeeScript’s other contributors, who are too numerous to name here.<a id="FNPTR-1" href="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>

    Thanks to the technical reviewers—any remaining errors are completely and utterly “my bad.” I received helpful feedback from Javier Collado, Kevin Gisi, Darcy Laycock, Scott Leberknight, Sam Stephenson, Travis Swicegood, Federico Tomassetti, Stefan Turalski, and Dr. Nic Williams. Special shout-outs to Jeremy Ashkenas (again) and Michael Ficarra, core contributors to the CoffeeScript project who took time from their busy schedules to set me straight on many of the language’s finer points. Thanks also to Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, who graciously clarified several points.
  </p>

    Thanks to the Pragmatic Bookshelf crowd. First and foremost to Michael Swaine, whom I’m proud to call my editor. Thanks also to managing editor Susannah Pfalzer and to bigwigs Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt for taking a chance on a book on a lesser-known language from an even less-known author.
  </p>
<p id="N100E3" class="calibre5">
    Thanks, finally, to Scott and Teresa Burnham, more commonly referred to by me and at least two other people as “Dad” and “Mom.” Their support, and their example, has been valuable beyond measure.
