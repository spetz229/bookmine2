<p class="docText1">We use three class-level annotations to describe a class's <span class="docEmphasis">intended</span> thread-safety promises: <tt class="calibre25">@Immutable</tt>, <tt class="calibre25">@ThreadSafe</tt>, and <tt class="calibre25">@NotThreadSafe</tt>. <tt class="calibre25">@Immutable</tt> means, of course, that the class is immutable, and implies <tt class="calibre25">@ThreadSafe</tt>. <tt class="calibre25">@NotThreadSafe</tt> is optionalif a class is not annotated as thread-safe, it should be presumed not to be thread-safe, but if you want to make it extra clear, use <tt class="calibre25">@NotThreadSafe</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText1">These annotations are relatively unintrusive and are beneficial to both users and maintainers. Users can see immediately whether a class is thread-safe, and maintainers can see immediately whether thread-safety guarantees must be preserved. Annotations are also useful to a third constituency: tools. Static codeanalysis tools may be able to verify that the code complies with the contract indicated by the annotation, such as verifying that a class annotated with <tt class="calibre25">@Immutable</tt> actually is immutable.</p>
