<p class="docText1">Unfortunately, <tt class="calibre25">UnsafeCountingFactorizer</tt> is not thread-safe, even though it would work just fine in a single-threaded environment.

Instead, it is a shorthand for a sequence of three discrete operations: fetch the current value, add one to it, and write the new value back. This is an example of a <span class="docEmphasis">read-modify-write</span> operation, in which the resulting state is derived from the previous state.</p>

This is clearly not what is supposed to happen; an increment got lost along the way, and the hit counter is now permanently off by one.</p>
<p class="docText1">You might think that having a slightly inaccurate count of hits in a web-based service is an acceptable loss of accuracy, and sometimes it is.

<h4 id="title-IDA2WD2V" class="docSection2Title">2.2.1. Race Conditions</h4>
<p class="docText1"><tt class="calibre25">UnsafeCountingFactorizer</tt> has several <span class="docEmphasis">race conditions</span> that make its results unreliable. A race condition occurs when the correctness of a computation depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads by the runtime; in other words, when getting the right answer relies on lucky timing. <sup class="docFootnote"><a class="calibre2" href="#ch02fn04">[4]</a></sup> The most common type of race condition is <span class="docEmphasis">check-then-act</span>, where a potentially stale observation is used to make a decision on what to do next.</p><blockquote class="calibre19"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre27"><a name="ch02fn04" class="calibre18" id="ch02fn04">[4]</a></sup> The term <span class="docEmphasis">race condition</span> is often confused with the related term <span class="docEmphasis">data race</span>, which arises when synchronization is not used to coordinate all access to a shared nonfinal field. You risk a data race whenever a thread writes a variable that might next be read by another thread or reads a variable that might have last been written by another thread if both threads do not use synchronization; code with data races has no useful defined semantics under the Java Memory Model. Not all race conditions are data races, and not all data races are race conditions, but they both can cause concurrent programs to fail in unpredictable ways. <tt class="calibre35">UnsafeCountingFactorizer</tt> has both race conditions and data races. See <a class="calibre2" href="ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a> for more on data races.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText1">We often encounter race conditions in real life. Let's say you planned to meet a friend at noon at the Starbucks on University Avenue. But when you get there, you realize there are <span class="docEmphasis">two</span> Starbucks on University Avenue, and you're not sure which one you agreed to meet at. At 12:10, you don't see your friend at Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, so you walk over to Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> to see if he's there, but he isn't there either. There are a few possibilities: your friend is late and not at either Starbucks; your friend arrived at Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> after you left; or your friend <span class="docEmphasis">was</span> at Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, but went to look for you, and is now en route to Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>. Let's assume the worst and say it was the last possibility. Now it's 12:15, you've both been to both Starbucks, and you're both wondering if you've been stood up. What do you do now? Go back to the other Starbucks? How many times are you going to go back <a name="iddle1331" class="calibre18" id="iddle1331"></a><a name="iddle2126" class="calibre18" id="iddle2126"></a><a name="iddle2736" class="calibre18" id="iddle2736"></a><a name="iddle2737" class="calibre18" id="iddle2737"></a><a name="iddle2946" class="calibre18" id="iddle2946"></a><a name="iddle2947" class="calibre18" id="iddle2947"></a><a name="iddle3712" class="calibre18" id="iddle3712"></a>and forth? Unless you have agreed on a protocol, you could both spend the day walking up and down University Avenue, frustrated and undercaffeinated.</p>
<p class="docText1">The problem with the "I'll just nip up the street and see if he's at the other one" approach is that while you're walking up the street, your friend might have moved. You look around Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">A</span>, observe "he's not here", and go looking for him. And you can do the same for Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, but <span class="docEmphasis">not at the same time</span>. It takes a few minutes to walk up the street, and during those few minutes, <span class="docEmphasis">the state of the system may have changed</span>.</p>
<p class="docText1">The Starbucks example illustrates a race condition because reaching the desired outcome (meeting your friend) depends on the relative timing of events (when each of you arrives at one Starbucks or the other, how long you wait there before switching, etc). The observation that he is not at Starbucks <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> becomes potentially invalid as soon as you walk out the front door; he could have come in through the back door and you wouldn't know. It is this invalidation of observations that characterizes most race conditionsusing a potentially stale observation to make a decision or perform a computation. This type of race condition is called <span class="docEmphasis">check-then-act</span>: you observe something to be true (file <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> doesn't exist) and then take action based on that observation (create <span class="docEmphasis">X</span>); but in fact the observation could have become invalid between the time you observed it and the time you acted on it (someone else created <span class="docEmphasis">X</span> in the meantime), causing a problem (unexpected exception, overwritten data, file corruption).</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAW1D2V" class="docSection2Title">2.2.2. Example: Race Conditions in Lazy Initialization</h4>
<p class="docText1">A common idiom that uses check-then-act is <span class="docEmphasis">lazy initialization</span>. The goal of lazy initialization is to defer initializing an object until it is actually needed while at the same time ensuring that it is initialized only once. <tt class="calibre25">LazyInitRace</tt> in <a class="calibre2" href="#ch02list03">Listing 2.3</a> illustrates the lazy initialization idiom. The <tt class="calibre25">getInstance</tt> method first checks whether the <tt class="calibre25">ExpensiveObject</tt> has already been initialized, in which case it returns the existing instance; otherwise it creates a new instance and returns it after retaining a reference to it so that future invocations can avoid the more expensive code path.</p>

Say that threads <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> execute <tt class="calibre25">getInstance</tt> at the same time. <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> sees that <tt class="calibre25">instance</tt> is <tt class="calibre25">null</tt>, and instantiates a new <tt class="calibre25">ExpensiveObject</tt>. <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> also checks if <tt class="calibre25">instance</tt> is <tt class="calibre25">null</tt>. Whether <tt class="calibre25">instance</tt> is <tt class="calibre25">null</tt> at this point depends unpredictably on timing, including the vagaries of scheduling and how long <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> takes to instantiate the <tt class="calibre25">ExpensiveObject</tt> and set the <tt class="calibre25">instance</tt> field. If <tt class="calibre25">instance</tt> is <tt class="calibre25">null</tt> when <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> examines it, the two callers to <tt class="calibre25">getInstance</tt> may receive two different results, even though <tt class="calibre25">getInstance</tt> is always supposed to return the same instance.</p>
<p class="docText1">The hit-counting operation in <tt class="calibre25">UnsafeCountingFactorizer</tt> has another sort of race condition. Read-modify-write operations, like incrementing a counter, define a transformation of an object's state in terms of its previous state. To increment a counter, you have to know its previous value <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> make sure no one else changes or uses that value while you are in mid-update.</p>
<p class="docText1">Like most concurrency errors, race conditions don't <span class="docEmphasis">always</span> result in failure: some unlucky timing is also required. But race conditions can cause serious problems. If <tt class="calibre25">LazyInitRace</tt> is used to instantiate an application-wide registry, having it return different instances from multiple invocations could cause registrations to be lost or multiple activities to have inconsistent views of the set of registered objects. If <tt class="calibre25">UnsafeSequence</tt> is used to generate entity identifiers in a persistence framework, two distinct objects could end up with the same ID, violating identity integrity constraints.</p>

To avoid race conditions, there must be a way to prevent other threads from using a variable while we're in the middle of modifying it, so we can ensure that other threads can observe or modify the state only before we start or after we finish, but not in the middle.</p>
