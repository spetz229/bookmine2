<a name="pref01" class="calibre18" id="pref01"></a><h2 id="title-IDAG0WDS" class="docPrefaceTitle">Advance Praise for <span class="docEmphasis1">Java Concurrency in Practice</span></h2><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Martin Buchholz<br class="calibre11"/>JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <span class="docEmphasis">Java Concurrency in Practice</span> provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today'sand tomorrow'ssystems.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Doron Rajwan<br class="calibre11"/>Research Scientist, Intel Corp</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">This is the book you need if you're writingor designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplatingmultithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Ted Neward<br class="calibre11"/>Author of</span> Effective Enterprise Java</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Kirk Pepperdine<br class="calibre11"/>CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Dr. Cliff Click<br class="calibre11"/>Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Dr. Heinz Kabutz<br class="calibre11"/>The Java Specialists' Newsletter</span></p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1">I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject: concurrency. <span class="docEmphasis">Java Concurrency in Practice</span> is revolutionary in its approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its deliveryit's destined to be a very important book.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Bruce Tate<br class="calibre11"/>Author of</span> Beyond Java</p></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre19">
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Java Concurrency in Practice</span> is an invaluable compilation of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="docEmphasis">Bill Venners<br class="calibre11"/>Author of</span> Inside the Java Virtual Machine</p></blockquote>
