      No matter what kind of ninja you are—a cooking ninja, a corporate
  lawyer ninja, or an actual <span><em class="calibre8">ninja</em></span> ninja—virtuosity lies
  in first mastering the basic tools of the trade. Once conquered, it’s then
  up to the full-fledged ninja to apply that knowledge in creative and
  inventive ways.

  
      In recent times, jQuery has proven itself to be a simple but powerful
  tool for taming and transforming web pages, bending even the most stubborn
  and aging browsers to our will. jQuery is a library with two principal
  purposes: manipulating elements on a web page, and helping out with Ajax
  requests. Sure, there are quite a few commands available to do this, but
  they’re all consistent and easy to learn. Once you’ve chained together your
  first few actions, you’ll be addicted to the jQuery building blocks, and
  your friends and family will wish you’d never discovered it!

  
      On top of the core jQuery library is jQuery UI: a set of fine-looking
  controls and widgets (such as accordions, tabs, and dialogs), combined with
  a collection of full-featured behaviors for implementing controls of your
  own. jQuery UI lets you quickly throw together awesome interfaces with
  little effort, and serves as a great example of what you can achieve with a
  little jQuery know-how.

  
      At its core, jQuery is a tool to help us improve the usability of our
  sites and create a better user experience. <span><strong class="calibre9">Usability</strong></span>
  refers to the study of the principles behind an object’s <span><em class="calibre8">perceived
  efficiency or elegance</em></span>. Far from being merely flashy, trendy
  design, jQuery lets us speedily sculpt our pages in ways both subtle and
  extreme: from finessing a simple sliding panel to implementing a brand-new
  user interaction you invented in your sleep.

  
      Becoming a ninja isn’t about learning an API inside out and back to
  front; that’s just having a good memory. The real skill and value comes when
  you can apply your knowledge to making something exceptional: something that
  builds on the combined insights of the past to be even slightly better than
  anything anyone has done before. This is certainly not easy, but thanks to
  jQuery, it’s fun just trying.

         If you’re a front-end web designer looking to add a dash of cool
    interactivity to your sites, and you’ve heard all the buzz surrounding
    jQuery and want to find out what the fuss is about, this book will put you
    on the right track. If you’ve dabbled with JavaScript, but have been
    frustrated by the complexity of many seemingly simple tasks, we’ll show
    you how jQuery can help out. Even if you’re familiar with the basics of
    jQuery, but want to take your skills to the next level, you’ll find a
    wealth of good coding advice and in-depth knowledge.

    
         You should already have intermediate to advanced HTML and CSS
    skills, as jQuery uses CSS-style selectors to zero in on page elements.
    Some rudimentary programming knowledge will be helpful to have, as
    jQuery—despite its clever abstractions—is still based on JavaScript. That
    said, we’ve tried to explain any JavaScript concepts as we use them, so
    with a little willingness to learn you’ll do fine.

         By the end of this book, you’ll be able to take your static HTML and
    CSS web pages and bring them to life with a bit of jQuery magic. You’ll
    learn how to select elements on the page, move them around, remove them
    entirely, add new ones with Ajax, animate them … in short, you’ll be able
    to bend HTML and CSS to your will! We also cover the powerful
    functionality of the jQuery UI library, and investigate the recently
    released jQuery Mobile framework.

    
         This book comprises the following nine chapters and three
    appendices. Read them in order from beginning to end to gain a complete
    understanding of the subject, or skip around if you only need a refresher
    on a particular topic.

                  Before we dive into learning all the ins and outs of jQuery,
          we’ll have a quick look at why you’d want to use it in the first
          place: why it’s better than writing your own JavaScript, and why
          it’s better than the other JavaScript libraries out there. We’ll
          brush up on some CSS concepts that are key to understanding jQuery,
          and briefly touch on the basic syntax required to call jQuery into
          action.

                  Ostensibly, jQuery’s most significant advantage over plain
          JavaScript is the ease with which it lets you select elements on the
          page to play with. We’ll start off this chapter by teaching you how
          to use jQuery’s selectors to zero in on your target elements, and
          then we’ll look at how you can use jQuery to alter those elements’
          CSS properties.

               </span></dt><dd class="calibre10">
          
                  jQuery excels at animation: whether you’d like to gently slide
          open a menu or send a dialog whizzing across the screen, jQuery can
          help you out. In this chapter, we’ll explore jQuery’s wide range of
          animation helpers, and put them into practice by enhancing a few
          simple user interface components. We’ll also have a quick look at
          some animation-like helpers for scrolling the page and making
          elements resizable.

                  With the basics well and truly under our belts, we’ll turn to
          building some of the most common jQuery widgets out there: image
          galleries and slideshows. We’ll learn how to build lightbox
          displays, scrolling thumbnail galleries and cross-fading galleries,
          and even take a stab at an iPhoto-style flip-book.

               </span></dt><dd class="calibre10">
          
                  Now that we’re comfortable with building cool UI widgets with
          jQuery, we’ll dive into some slightly more sophisticated controls:
          drop-down and accordion-style menus, tabbed interfaces, tooltips,
          and various types of content panels. We’re really on a roll now: our
          sites are looking less and less like the brochure-style pages of the
          1990s, and more and more like the Rich Internet Applications of the
          21st century!

                  This is the one you’ve all been waiting for: Ajax! In order to
          make truly desktop-style applications on the Web, you need to be
          able to pass data back and forth to and from the server without any
          of those pesky refreshes clearing your interface from the screen—and
          that’s what Ajax is all about. jQuery includes a raft of convenient
          methods for handling Ajax requests in a simple, cross-browser
          manner, letting you leave work with a smile on your face. But before
          we get too carried away, our code is growing more complex, so we’d
          better take a look at some best practices for organizing it.

                  The bane of every designer, forms are nonetheless the
          cornerstone of any web application. In this chapter, we’ll learn
          what jQuery has to offer us in terms of simplifying our form-related
          scripting. We’ll learn how to validate forms on the fly, offer
          assistance to our users, and manipulate checkboxes, radio buttons,
          and select lists with ease. Then we’ll have a look at some less
          conventional ways of allowing a site’s users to interact with it: a
          variety of advanced controls like date pickers, sliders, and drag
          and drop. We’ll round it off with a look at modal dialogs in the
          post-popup world, as well as a few original nonmodal notification
          styles. What a chapter!

                  No matter how “Web 2.0” your application may be, chances are
          you’ll still need to fall back on the everyday list, the humdrum
          tree, or even the oft-derided table to present information to your
          users. This chapter will show how jQuery can make even the boring
          stuff fun, as we’ll learn how to transform lists into dynamic,
          sortable data, and tables into data grids with sophisticated
          functionality.

          requests, and funky UI components. It has a wealth of functionality
          aimed at the more <span><em class="calibre8">ninja-level</em></span> developer: a
          fantastic plugin architecture, a highly extensible and flexible
          core, customizable events, and a whole lot more. In this chapter,
          we’ll cover the jQuery UI theme system, which lets you easily tailor
          the appearance of jQuery UI widgets to suit your site, and even make
          your own plugins skinnable with themes. We’ll also take a look at
          using the brand new jQuery Mobile framework, so that you can deploy
          your ninja skills on handheld devices.

            I’d like to thank Zenexity for teaching me everything I need to
      know about both Paris and functional programming, Stuart Horton-Stephens
      for showing me how to find beauty in even the most disturbing internet
      meme, the SitePoint gang for turning pages of rambling nonsense into
      English, the Sydney and Paris JavaScript community (who both truly
      rock), the jQuery team (and related fellows) for being a
      JavaScript-fueled inspiration to us all, and, finally, my awesome Mum
      and Dad for getting me a Spectravideo 318 instead of a Commodore 64—thus
      forcing me to read the manuals instead of playing games, all those years
      ago.

            In the acknowledgements from our first edition, I thanked my
      wonderful wife, Jennifer, for allowing me to type into the wee small
      hours and my parents for allowing me to read into the wee small hours
      when I was wee. Now Jennifer and I have a wee one of our own, Jemima,
      and I want to thank her for making every day so much more than a wee bit
      wonderful. Together with Earle and SitePoint, I’m privileged to be able
      to bring jQuery to a new generation of coders, but as good as it was to
      work with Earle and SitePoint once again, it’s only a wee privilege
      compared to watching Jemima grow.

      <div class="toc" title="Conventions Used in This Book"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><h2 class="title1"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e235" class="calibre5"></a>Conventions Used in This Book</h2></div></div></div>
    
         

    
         You’ll notice that we’ve used certain typographic and layout styles
    throughout the book to signify different types of information. Look out
    for the following items.

    
         <div class="toc" title="Code Samples"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><h3 class="title2"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e238" class="calibre5"></a>Code Samples</h3></div></div></div>
      
            

      
            Code in this book will be displayed using a fixed-width font, like
      so:

      
            <pre class="programlisting">&lt;h1&gt;A Perfect Summer's Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely day for a walk in the park. The birds 
were singing and the kids were all back at school.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

      
            If the code is to be found in the book’s code archive, the name of
      the file will appear at the top of the program listing, like
      this:

      
            <div class="toc"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e243"></a><div xmlns:l="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/xmlns/l10n/1.0" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="sitepoint-formal-example-heading"><em class="calibre8" title="example.css">
		
                  <span class="sitepoint-formal-example-filename"><span>example.css</span></span>
               
	</em></div><div class="toc">
        
               

        
               <pre class="programlisting">.footer {
  background-color: #CCC;
  border-top: 1px solid #333;
}</pre>
      
            </div></div>

      
            If only part of the file is displayed, this is indicated by the
      word <span><em class="calibre8">excerpt</em></span>:

      
            <div class="toc"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e249"></a><div xmlns:l="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/xmlns/l10n/1.0" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="sitepoint-formal-example-heading"><em class="calibre8" title="example.css (excerpt)">
		
                  <span class="sitepoint-formal-example-filename"><span>example.css</span></span> (excerpt)
	</em></div><div class="toc">
        
               

        
               <pre class="programlisting">  border-top: 1px solid #333;</pre>
      
            </div></div>

      
            If additional code is to be inserted into an existing example, the
      new code will be displayed in bold:

      
            <pre class="programlisting">function animate() {
  <span><strong class="calibre9">new_variable = "Hello";</strong></span>
}</pre>

      

      
            Also, where existing code is required for context, rather than
      repeat all the code, a vertical ellipsis (…) will be displayed:

      
            <pre class="programlisting">function animate() {
  …
  <span><strong class="calibre9">return new_variable;</strong></span>
}</pre>

      
            Some lines of code are intended to be entered on one line, but
      we’ve had to wrap them because of page constraints. A ↵ indicates a line
      break that exists for formatting purposes only, and should be
      ignored:

      
            <pre class="programlisting">URL.open("http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/05/28/user-style-she
↵ets-come-of-age/");</pre>
    
         </div>

    
         <div class="toc" title="Tips, Notes, and Warnings"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><h3 class="title2"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e261" class="calibre5"></a>Tips, Notes, and Warnings</h3></div></div></div>
      
            

      
            <div class="tip" title="Tip: Hey, You!"><h3 class="title2">Tip: Hey, You!</h3>
        
               

        
               Tips will give you helpful little pointers.
      
            </div>

      
            <div class="tip" title="Note: Ahem, Excuse Me …"><h3 class="title2">Note: Ahem, Excuse Me …</h3>
        
               

        
               Notes are useful asides that are related—but not critical—to the
        topic at hand. Think of them as extra tidbits of information.
      
            </div>

      
            <div class="tip" title="Important: Make Sure You Always …"><h3 class="title2">Important: Make Sure You Always …</h3>
        
               

        
               … pay attention to these important points.
      
            </div>

      
            <div class="tip" title="Warning: Watch Out!"><h3 class="title2">Warning: Watch Out!</h3>
        
               

        
               Warnings will highlight any gotchas that are likely to trip you
        up along the way.
      
            </div>
    
         </div>
  
      </div>

   </div></div>
