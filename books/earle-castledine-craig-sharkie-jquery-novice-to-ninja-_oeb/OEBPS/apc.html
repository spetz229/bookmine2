      There are a few jQuery properties and actions that, although applying
  to any jQuery selection, are particularly useful for plugin development. The
  reason they’re hidden away in this appendix is that they’re not commonly
  used. Despite this, they’re quite powerful, and you should familiarize
  yourself with them if you intend to spend time developing plugins.

  
      <div class="toc" title="Selector and Context"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><h2 class="title1"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e14735" class="calibre5"></a>Selector and Context</h2></div></div></div>
    
         

    
         
            <a id="chc-001b"></a>
            <a id="chc-001c"></a>The first ones we’ll look at are the
    <code class="email">selector</code> and <code class="email">context</code> properties.
    These work together to show you what jQuery thinks it’s working on. These
    are basically internal methods, but depending on what your plugin is
    doing, it can be good to know.

    
         The <a id="chc-001a"></a>
            <a id="chc-001"></a>
            <code class="email">selector</code> property returns a string
    value of the current jQuery selector string, so the command
    <code class="email">$('p:first').selector</code> will return the string
    <code class="email">"p:first"</code>. This is useful in your plugins if you need
    to know what the user originally selected.

    
         You might think that the optional second parameter to the jQuery
    selector, which is called <a id="chc-002"></a>
            <a id="chc-002a"></a>
            <code class="email">context</code>, is what you’d obtain with the
    <code class="email">context</code> property—but it’s a bit trickier than that.
    In fact, if you supply <code class="email">context</code> as a string, it’s
    converted internally to a regular jQuery statement, which will actually
    affect the <code class="email">selector</code> property:

    
         <pre class="programlisting">var selector = $('p:first', '#content').selector
var context = $('p:first', '#content').context</pre>

    
         In the aforementioned example, the <code class="email">selector</code>
    resolves to <code class="email">"#content p:first"</code> and the
    <code class="email">context</code> resolves to <code class="email">Document</code> (the
    context that all your selectors will default to). The
    <code class="email">context</code> property is only modified if you supply an
    actual DOM node to it:

    
         <pre class="programlisting">var domContext = $('#content')[0]; // Get the DOM element
var selector = $('p:first', domContext).selector;
var context = $('p:first', domContext).context;</pre>

    
         In this case, the <code class="email">selector</code> will be reported as
    <code class="email">"p:first"</code>, and the <code class="email">context</code> will be
    the DOM element itself (for this example, it’s the
    <code class="email">&lt;div id="content"&gt;</code> element).

    
         Specifying the DOM node provides no guarantee that your queries will
    run faster; internally jQuery’s selector engine will only search inside
    the context you specify anyway, even though the
    <code class="email">context</code> property will be reported as
    <code class="email">Document</code>.<a id="d4e14784"></a>
            <a id="d4e14785"></a>
            <a id="d4e14786"></a>
            <a id="d4e14787"></a>
            <a id="d4e14788"></a>
            <a id="d4e14789"></a>

      <div class="toc" title="The jQuery Stack"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><h2 class="title1"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e14790" class="calibre5"></a>The jQuery Stack<a id="chc-003" class="calibre5"></a>
         </h2></div></div></div>
    
         

    
         To make our plugins play nicely with jQuery, we’ve learned that we
    should return each jQuery element from our code, so that commands can
    continue to be chained after our plugin. Generally, we just modify
    elements in the selection before we pass them back, but sometimes we want
    to alter the items that are returned—perhaps remove some elements, or add
    some new ones. The best way to accomplish this is via the <a id="chc-004"></a>
            <code class="email">pushStack</code> action. This is a
    convenient way to create a jQuery selection for inclusion in the
    chain.

    
         
            <a id="chc-003a"></a>By way of example, we’ll set up a small plugin that
    retrieves the elements that surround the selected element. The use case
    might be to highlight the next and previous items in a list of elements.
    Our plugin will also wrap around if the selected item is the first or last
    in the list:

    
         <pre class="programlisting">jQuery.fn.surrounds = function() {
  var prev = this.index() == 0 ? 
    this.siblings(':last') : 
    this.prev();
  var next = this.index() == this.siblings().length ? 
    this.siblings(':first') : 
    this.next();

  var newStack = prev.add(next);
  return this.pushStack(newStack, 'surrounds', '');
};</pre>

    
         The plugin retrieves the previous and next elements, and combines
    them into one selection with the <a id="chc-005"></a>
            <code class="email">add</code> action. This new collection is
    returned via <code class="email">pushStack</code>, which accepts the
    collection, a name for it, and a name for the selector string. The two
    name parameters will be readable by the <a id="chc-006"></a>
            <code class="email">selector</code> property we looked at above.
    To use this plugin, we might apply it to an unordered list called
    categories, like so:

    
         <pre class="programlisting">$('#categories li:first')
  .surrounds()
  .css('color', 'red')
  .end()
  .css('color', 'blue'); </pre>

    
         This will select the two elements that surround the first list item,
    then color them red. Because we’ve used
    <code class="email">pushStack</code>, the jQuery chain remains intact; we
    can then use the <a id="chc-007a"></a>
            <a id="chc-007"></a>
            <code class="email">end</code> command to move back to the
    original selection (the first list item), and color it blue. You can use
    <code class="email">pushStack</code> anytime you want to manipulate the
    chain like this.

    
         The last trick we’ll look at in regard to the jQuery internal
    <a id="chc-0079"></a>chain is the ability to access other steps in the chain. As
    you might remember, the <code class="email">end</code> action takes you back
    up one level to the last command that modified the jQuery selection. If
    you look into the jQuery core, you’ll see that
    <code class="email">end</code> is implemented using the <a id="chc-008"></a>
            <code class="email">prevObject</code> property. Inside your plugin
    you can gain access to the previous jQuery object by using
    <code class="email">this.prevObject</code>. If the previous object has a previous
    object, you can access this too!<a id="d4e14838"></a>
            <a id="d4e14839"></a>
            <a id="d4e14840"></a>
         
  
      </div>

  
      <div class="toc" title="Minification"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><div class="toc"><h2 class="title1"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d4e14841" class="calibre5"></a>Minification<a id="chc-009" class="calibre5"></a>

         </h2></div></div></div>
    
         

    
         You know there are two versions of jQuery, jQuery UI, and many
    jQuery plugins: an uncompressed version and a minified version. Why is
    this so?

    
         Regardless of which one you choose, when you add them to your page
    you gain access to all the features of jQuery (or the plugin in question).
    The difference is, of course, that the file size of the
    “<span xmlns:l="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/xmlns/l10n/1.0" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">.min</span>” version is markedly smaller. With jQuery
    coming in at around 250kB and the minified version at less than 100kB, you
    save well over half the file size in bandwidth. If your server, and your
    users’ browsers, support sending Gzipped files (most do these days), this
    can easily be halved again.

    
         And if the file is half as big, it’s delivered twice as fast. Faster
    downloads mean faster page loads, so you may be wondering how to enjoy the
    benefit of minified files with your own script files, and—more
    importantly—your plugins.

    
         There are a number of utilities you can use to compress your files,
    so we’ll go over a few of the more commonly used ones.

    
         The world of JavaScript minifiers ebbs and flows like the tide, as
    there have been a lot of players come and go over the last five years.
    Those who have been around for a while include <a id="chc-010"></a>
            <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">Yahoo’s YUI
    Compressor</a> and <a id="chc-011"></a>
            <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google’s Closure
    Compiler.</a> Another major player is <a id="chc-012"></a>
            <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS,</a> which the
    jQuery team themselves use for minification.

    
         Both solutions work by eliminating whitespace and shortening
    variable and function names. The code becomes obfuscated by human
    standards, but the browser’s JavaScript engine has no trouble interpreting
    the code output. So, for example, this human-readable code:

    
         <pre class="programlisting">$growl.animate({
  border: "none",
  height: 0,
  marginBottom: 0,
  marginTop: "-6px",
  opacity : 0,
  paddingBottom: 0,
  paddingTop: 0,
  queue: false
});</pre>

    
         … would be shortened to this:

    
         <pre class="programlisting">$growl.animate({border:"none",height:0,marginBottom:0,marginTop:
↵"-6px",opacity :0,paddingBottom:0,paddingTop:0,queue:false}</pre>

    
         The second statement has the whitespace removed, and you can already
    see that it’s taking up less space to achieve the same results. You can
    also see how it’s become more difficult to read. Multiply this effect by
    the 9,000-odd lines in the jQuery source, and you can imagine how
    difficult it would be to make any sense of it. And that’s without altering
    any names.

    
         The minifier you choose depends largely on your development
    environment and workflow. Both the <a id="chc-013"></a>Closure Compiler and <a id="chc-014"></a>YUI Compressor are Java applications that can be called from
    the command line. <a id="chc-015"></a>UglifyJS is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.JS. The
    overhead per run is a lot lower for Node compared to the Java Virtual
    Machine, which is important if you’re minifying a lot of individual files.
    Whichever option you choose, the method for minification is similar. For
    example, to compress a file such as <span xmlns:l="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/xmlns/l10n/1.0" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">hello.js</span> using
    Closure Compiler, you could do this:<pre class="programlisting">java -jar compiler.jar --js hello.js --js_output_file 
↵hello-compiled.js</pre>It can then be integrated into your build
    process, so you will automatically have minified and non-minified versions
    of your latest code.

    
         If you just need to minimize once-off, or are interested in what
    minifiers do, you could also try the online version of the <a id="chc-016"></a>
            <a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/">Closure
    Compiler</a> by pasting in the code and hitting “compile.”

    
         In the end, your choice of minifier mostly comes down to personal
    preference (though, seeing as it’s our book, we can say we like
    UglifyJS!). Some minifiers have a slightly smaller output, while others
    are faster to compile; ultimately, they are all continually refining their
    solutions, and are responsive to industry and community
    feedback.<a id="d4e14884"></a>
