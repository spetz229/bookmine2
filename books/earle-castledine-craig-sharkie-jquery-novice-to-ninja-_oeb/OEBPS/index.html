         <h2 class="sitepoint-aboutpage-authorblurb-title">About Earle Castledine</h2>

    
         Sporting a Masters in Information Technology and a lifetime of
    experience on the Web of Hard Knocks, Earle Castledine (aka Mr. Speaker)
    holds an interest in everything computery. Raised in the wild by various
    8-bit home computers, he settled in the Internet during the mid-nineties
    and has been living and working there ever since.

    
         A senior systems analyst and JavaScript flâneur, he is equally happy
    in the rapid rivers of Scala, the dense foliage of mobile apps and games,
    or the fluffy clouds of client-side interaction development.

    
         As co-creator of the client-side opus <a href="http://www.turntubelist.com/">TurnTubelist,</a> as well as
    countless web-based experiments, Earle recognizes the Internet not as a
    lubricant for social change but as a vehicle for unleashing frivolous
    ECMAScript gadgets and interesting time-wasting technologies.

         <h2 class="sitepoint-aboutpage-authorblurb-title">About Craig Sharkie</h2>

    
         A degree in Fine Art is a strange entrance to a career with a
    passion for programming, but that’s where Craig started. A right-brain
    approach to code and problem-solving has seen him plying his craft in many
    of the big names of the Web: AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Ziff-Davis, and
    Australia’s Atlassian. Today, you’ll find him coding HTML5 and JavaScript
    solutions for Telstra Media’s IPTV division, stretching the boundaries of
    where you might expect to find jQuery.

    
         His passion for programming and a fondness for serial commas and the
    like have led him on a path from journalism, through development, on to
    conferencing, and now into print. Taking up JavaScript in 1995, he was an
    evangelist for the “good parts” even before Crockford coined the term, and
    has seen the language flow from the desktop through mobile, and out to
    televisions and beyond. Being able to start the day with his new daughter
    just makes seeing where each day leads all the more fascinating.

         <h2 class="sitepoint-aboutpage-authorblurb-title">About Tom Museth</h2>

    
         Tom Museth first fell in love with code while creating scrolling
    adventure games in BASIC on his Commodore 64, and usability testing them
    on reluctant family members. He then spent 16 years as a journalist and
    production editor before deciding web development would be more rewarding.
    He has a passion for jQuery, PHP, HTML5, and CSS3; is eagerly eyeing the
    world of mobile dev; and likes to de-stress via a book, a beach, and a
    fishing rod.

         <h2 class="sitepoint-aboutpage-authorblurb-title">About Jörn Zaefferer</h2>

    
         Jörn Zaefferer is a freelance web developer, consultant, and
    trainer, residing in Cologne, Germany. Jörn evolved jQuery’s test suite
    into QUnit, a JavaScript unit-testing framework, and maintains it. He also
    created and maintains a number of popular plugins. As a jQuery UI
    development lead, he focuses on the development of new plugins, widgets,
    and utilities.
