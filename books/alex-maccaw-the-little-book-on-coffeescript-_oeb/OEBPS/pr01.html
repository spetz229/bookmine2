    little language that compiles down to JavaScript. The syntax is inspired
    by Ruby and Python, and implements many features from those two languages.
    This book is designed to help you learn CoffeeScript, understand best
    practices, and start building awesome client-side applications. The book
    is little, only six chapters, but that’s rather apt as CoffeeScript is a
    little language too.</p><p class="calibre8">This book is completely open source, and was written by <a class="ulink" href="http://alexmaccaw.co.uk">Alex MacCaw</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://twitter.com/maccman">@maccman</a>) with great
    contributions from <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/dxgriffiths">David
    Griffiths</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/satyr">Satoshi
    Murakami</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.coffeescriptlove.com">Chris Smith</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://about.me/knoguchi">Katsuya Noguchi</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>.</p><p class="calibre8">If you have any errata or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to open
    a ticket on the book’s <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/arcturo/library">GitHub page</a>. Readers may
    also be interested in <a class="ulink" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018421.do">JavaScript Web
    Applications</a> (O’Reilly), a book I authored that explores rich
    JavaScript applications and moving state to the client side.</p><p class="calibre8">So let’s dive right into it: why is CoffeeScript better than writing
    pure JavaScript? Well, for a start, there’s less code to write;
    CoffeeScript is very succinct, and takes white space into account. In my
    experience, this reduces code by a third to a half of the original pure
    JavaScript. In addition, CoffeeScript has some neat features, such as
    array comprehensions, prototype
    aliases, and classes that further reduce the amount of typing you need to do.</p><p class="calibre8">More importantly though, JavaScript has a lot of <a class="ulink" href="http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/">skeletons in its
    closet</a> which can often trip up inexperienced developers.
    CoffeeScript neatly sidesteps these by only exposing a curated selection
    of JavaScript features, fixing many of the language’s oddities.</p><p class="calibre8">CoffeeScript is <span class="firstname"><em class="calibre5">not</em></span> a superset of JavaScript,
    so although you can use external JavaScript libraries from inside
    CoffeeScript, you’ll get syntax errors if you compile JavaScript as is,
    without converting it. The compiler converts CoffeeScript code into its
    counterpart JavaScript, there’s no interpretation at runtime.</p><p class="calibre8">So let’s get some common fallacies out of the way. You will need to
    know JavaScript in order to write CoffeeScript, as runtime errors require
    JavaScript knowledge. However,
    having said that, runtime errors are usually pretty obvious, and so far I
    haven’t found mapping JavaScript
    back to CoffeeScript to be an issue. The second problem I’ve often heard
    associated with CoffeeScript is speed (i.e., the code produced by the
    CoffeeScript compiler would run
    slower than its equivalent written in pure JavaScript). In practice
    though, it turns out this isn’t a problem either. CoffeeScript tends to
    run as fast or faster than handwritten JavaScript.</p><p class="calibre8">What are the disadvantages of using CoffeeScript? Well, it
    introduces another compile step between you and your JavaScript.
    CoffeeScript tries to mitigate the issue as best it can by producing clean
    and readable JavaScript, and with its server integrations which automate
    compilation. The other disadvantage, as with any new language, is the fact
    that the community is still small at this point, and you’ll have a hard
    time finding fellow collaborators who already know the language.
    CoffeeScript is quickly gaining momentum though, and its IRC list is well
    staffed; any questions you have are usually answered promptly.</p><p class="calibre8">CoffeeScript is not limited to the browser, and can be used to great
    effect in server-side JavaScript implementations, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Additionally, CoffeeScript is
    getting much wider use and integration, such as being a default in Rails
    3.1. Now is definitely the time to jump on the CoffeeScript train. The
    time you invest in learning about the language now will be repaid by major
    time savings later.</p></div></div></div>
