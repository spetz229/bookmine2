    it’s probably too pragmatic for its own good. The golden rule of
    CoffeeScript is: “It’s just JavaScript.”</p><p class="calibre8">We want to embrace the limitations of compiling to JavaScript by
    only implementing things that can be expressed in simple JS, and leaving
    fancier compilations to <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS">other
    languages</a>. When you run a script, there is no CoffeeScript
    interpreter running within the browser, no core library you have to
    include on the page, and ideally (although we bend this rule in a few
    places) no special helper functions generated alongside your code.</p><p class="calibre8">The downside of this approach is that more invasive improvements to
    JavaScript are impossible. For example, it would be nice if <code class="literal">list[-1]</code> in CoffeeScript could return the last
    item in the list. At first glance, it seems simple enough to implement,
    and would be useful. Unfortunately, any expression may be used to index
    into an array, so with negative array indices you would have to add a
    special check to every <code class="literal">list[x]</code>
    operation to ask if <code class="literal">x</code> is a positive
    number or a negative one. This would take CoffeeScript away from
    JavaScript semantics, and more importantly, JavaScript levels of performance—the array accesses in your inner
    loops would slow down considerably. For this reason, CoffeeScript doesn’t
    add negative array indices to the language.</p><p class="calibre8">The upside of this approach is that CoffeeScript is inherently
    compatible with every JavaScript runtime. Because we can compile to
    efficient, lowest-common-denominator code, CoffeeScript runs as well as
    JavaScript in every browser, in Node.js, in Rhino, in Photoshop and
    Illustrator—in short, everywhere JavaScript can run. If you want to use
    CoffeeScript for a project, for a component, or even just for a single
    file, you don’t have to sacrifice performance or compatibility with other
    JavaScript libraries.</p></div></div>
