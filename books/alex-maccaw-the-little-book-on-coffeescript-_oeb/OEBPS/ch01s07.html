<div class="book" title="Arrays"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect11_d1e839" class="calibre2"></a>Arrays</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">CoffeeScript takes inspiration from Ruby when it comes to array
    slicing by using ranges. Ranges are created by two numerical values, the
    first and last positions in the range, separated by <code class="literal">..</code> or <code class="literal">...</code>. If
    a range isn’t prefixed by anything, CoffeeScript expands it out into an
    array:</p><pre class="screen">range = [1..5]</pre><p class="calibre8">If, however, the range is specified immediately after a variable,
    CoffeeScript converts it into a <code class="literal">slice()</code>
    method call:</p><pre class="screen">firstTwo = ["one", "two", "three"][0..1]</pre><p class="calibre8">In the example above, the range returns a new array, containing only
    the first two elements of the original array. You can also use the same
    syntax for replacing an array segment with another array:</p><pre class="screen">numbers = [0..9]
numbers[3..5] = [-3, -4, -5]</pre><p class="calibre8">What’s neat, is that JavaScript allows you to call <code class="literal">slice()</code> on strings too, so you can use ranges
    with string to return a new subset of characters:</p><pre class="screen">my = "my string"[0..1]</pre><p class="calibre8">Checking to see if a value exists inside an array is always a bore
    in JavaScript, particularly because <code class="literal">indexOf()</code> doesn’t yet have full cross-browser
    support (Internet Explorer, I’m talking about you). CoffeeScript solves
    this with the <code class="literal">in</code> operator, for
    example:</p><pre class="screen">words = ["rattled", "roudy", "rebbles", "ranks"]
alert "Stop wagging me" if "ranks" in words</pre></div></div>
