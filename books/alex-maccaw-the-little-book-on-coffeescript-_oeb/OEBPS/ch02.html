  effect that cloves of garlic have to Dracula; although, let’s be honest, if
  you’re that way inclined, you’re unlikely to be reading a book on
  CoffeeScript. However, it turns out that classes are just as useful in
  JavaScript as they are in other languages and CoffeeScript provides a great
  abstraction.</p><p class="calibre8">Behind the scenes, CoffeeScript is using JavaScript’s native prototype
  to create classes; adding a bit of syntactic sugar for static property
  inheritance and context persistence. As a developer, all that’s exposed to
  you is the <code class="literal">class</code> keyword:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal</pre><p class="calibre8">In the example above, <code class="literal">Animal</code> is the
  name of the class, and also the name of the resultant variable that you can
  use to create instances. Behind the scenes, CoffeeScript is using
  constructor functions, which means you can instantiate classes using the
  <code class="literal">new</code> operator:</p><pre class="screen">animal = new Animal</pre><p class="calibre8">Defining constructors (functions that get invoked upon instantiation)
  is simple—just use a function named <code class="literal">constructor</code>. This is akin to using Ruby’s <code class="literal">initialize</code> or Python’s <code class="literal">__init__</code>:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal
  constructor: (name) -&gt;
    @name = name</pre><p class="calibre8">In fact, CoffeeScript provides a shorthand for the common pattern of
  setting instance properties. By prefixing arguments with <code class="literal">@</code>, CoffeeScript will automatically set the arguments as instance properties in the
  constructor. Indeed, this shorthand will also work for normal functions
  outside classes. The example below is equivalent to the last example, where
  we set the instance properties manually:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal
  constructor: (@name) -&gt;</pre><p class="calibre8">As you’d expect, any arguments passed on instantiation are proxied to
  the constructor function:</p><pre class="screen">animal = new Animal("Parrot")
alert "Animal is a #{animal.name}"</pre><div class="book" title="Instance Properties"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect12_d1e1003" class="calibre2"></a>Instance Properties</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Adding additional instance properties to a class is very
    straightforward; it’s exactly the same syntax as adding properties on an
    object. Just make sure properties are indented correctly inside the class
    body:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal
  price: 5

  sell: (customer) -&gt;

animal = new Animal
animal.sell(new Customer)</pre><p class="calibre8">Context changes are rife within JavaScript, and in <a class="ulink" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. CoffeeScript Syntax">Chapter 1</a> we talked about how CoffeeScript can lock
    the value of <code class="literal">this</code> to a particular
    context using a fat arrow function: <code class="literal">=&gt;</code>. This ensures that whatever context a
    function is called under, it’ll always execute inside the context it was
    created in. CoffeeScript has extended support for fat arrows to classes,
    so by using a fat arrow for an instance method you’ll ensure that it’s
    invoked in the correct context, and that <code class="literal">this</code> is always equal to the current
    instance:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal
  price: 5

  sell: =&gt;
    alert "Give me #{@price} shillings!"

animal = new Animal
$("#sell").click(animal.sell)</pre><p class="calibre8">As demonstrated in the example above, this is especially useful in
    event callbacks. Normally, the <code class="literal">sell()</code>
    function would be invoked in the context of the <code class="literal">#sell</code> element. However, by using fat arrows for
    <code class="literal">sell()</code>, we’re ensuring the correct
    context is being maintained, and that <code class="literal">this.price</code> equals <code class="literal">5</code>.</p></div></div></div>
