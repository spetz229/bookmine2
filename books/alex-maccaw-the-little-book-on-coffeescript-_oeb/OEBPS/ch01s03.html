    pair of braces and key/value
    statements. However, like with function invocation, CoffeeScript makes the
    braces optional. In fact, you can also use indentation and new lines
    instead of comma separation:</p><pre class="screen">object1 = {one: 1, two: 2}

# Without braces
object2 = one: 1, two: 2

# Using new lines instead of commas
object3 = 
  one: 1
  two: 2

User.create(name: "John Smith")</pre><p class="calibre8">Likewise, arrays can use white space instead of comma separators,
    although the square brackets (<code class="literal">[]</code>) are
    still required:</p><pre class="screen">array1 = [1, 2, 3]

array2 = [
  1
  2
  3
]

array3 = [1,2,3,]</pre><p class="calibre8">As you can see in this example, CoffeeScript has also stripped the
    trailing comma in <code class="literal">array3</code>, another
    common source of cross-browser errors.</p></div></div>
