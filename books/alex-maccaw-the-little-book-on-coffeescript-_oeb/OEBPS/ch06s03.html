I
    hope that this book doesn’t merely serve as an introduction, but spurs you
    to experiment with compile-to-JavaScript languages of your very
    own.</p><p class="calibre8">To that end, the CoffeeScript compiler has been <a class="ulink" href="http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/grammar.html">fully
    annotated with commentary</a> to make it easier to get started
    prototyping changes and improvements. The entire thing is only around
    2,500 lines of code, and there have been a <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/satyr/coco">number</a> of <a class="ulink" href="http://weepy.github.com/kaffeine/">interesting</a> <a class="ulink" href="http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/">forks</a> already that
    push JavaScript in different directions.</p><p class="calibre8">If you’ve ever felt confined by JavaScript, there’s no need to wait
    around for browser implementors or the slow march of the standards
    process. By using a compile-to-JS language, you can give yourself the
    JavaScript of your dreams today. I’m looking forward to seeing more little languages out
    there in the wild soon.</p></div></div>
