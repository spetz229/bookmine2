    Model-view-presenter (MVP) is a derivative of the MVC design pattern
    which focuses on improving presentation logic. It originated at a
    company named
    <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent">Taligent</a>
    in the early 1990s while they were working on a model for a C++
    CommonPoint environment. Whilst both MVC and MVP target the
    separation of concerns across multiple components, there are some
    fundamental differences between them.
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    For the purposes of this summary we will focus on the version of MVP
    most suitable for web-based architectures.
  </p><div class="book" title="Models, Views &amp; Presenters"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title3"><a id="models-views-presenters" class="calibre1"></a>Models, Views &amp; Presenters</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre6">
      The P in MVP stands for presenter. It’s a component which contains
      the user-interface business logic for the view. Unlike MVC,
      invocations from the view are delegated to the presenter, which
      are decoupled from the view and instead talk to it through an
      interface. This allows for all kinds of useful things such as
      being able to mock views in unit tests.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      The most common implementation of MVP is one which uses a Passive
      View (a view which is for all intents and purposes
      <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">dumb</span>”</span>), containing little to no logic. MVP models
      are almost identical to MVC models and handle application data.
      The presenter acts as a mediator which talks to both the view and
      model, however both of these are isolated from each other. They
      effectively bind models to views, a responsibility held by
      Controllers in MVC. Presenters are at the heart of the MVP pattern
      and as you can guess, incorporate the presentation logic behind
      views.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      Solicited by a view, presenters perform any work to do with user
      requests and pass data back to them. In this respect, they
      retrieve data, manipulate it and determine how the data should be
      displayed in the view. In some implementations, the presenter also
      interacts with a service layer to persist data (models). Models
      may trigger events but it’s the presenter’s role to subscribe to
      them so that it can update the view. In this passive architecture,
      we have no concept of direct data binding. Views expose setters
      which presenters can use to set data.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      The benefit of this change from MVC is that it increases the
      testability of your application and provides a more clean
      separation between the view and the model. This isn’t however
      without its costs as the lack of data binding support in the
      pattern can often mean having to take care of this task
      separately.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      Although a common implementation of a
      <a class="ulink" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html">Passive
      View</a> is for the view to implement an interface, there are
      variations on it, including the use of events which can decouple
      the View from the Presenter a little more. As we don’t have the
      interface construct in JavaScript, we’re using it more as more a
      protocol than an explicit interface here. It’s technically still
      an API and it’s probably fair for us to refer to it as an
      interface from that perspective.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      There is also a
      <a class="ulink" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html">Supervising
      Controller</a> variation of MVP, which is closer to the MVC
      and
      <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">MVVM</a>
      patterns as it provides data-binding from the Model directly from
      the View. Key-value observing (KVO) plugins (such as Derick
      Bailey’s Backbone.ModelBinding plugin) introduce this idea of a
      Supervising Controller to Backbone.
