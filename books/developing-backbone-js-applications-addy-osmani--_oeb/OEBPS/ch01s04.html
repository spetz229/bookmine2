    To summarize, the separation of concerns in MVC facilitates
    modularization of an application’s functionality and enables:
  </p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
        Easier overall maintenance. When updates need to be made to the
        application it is clear whether the changes are data-centric,
        meaning changes to models and possibly controllers, or merely
        visual, meaning changes to views.</p><div class="book"><p class="calibre6"></p></div><p class="calibre6">
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
        Decoupling models and views means that it’s straight-forward to
        write unit tests for business
        logic</p><div class="book"><p class="calibre6"></p></div><p class="calibre6">
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
        Duplication of low-level model and controller code is eliminated
        across the application
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
        Depending on the size of the application and separation of
        roles, this modularity allows developers responsible for core
        logic and developers working on the user-interfaces to work
        simultaneously

      Right now, you likely have a basic understanding of what the MVC
      pattern provides, but for the curious, we’ll explore it a little
      further.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      The GoF (Gang of Four) do not refer to MVC as a design pattern,
      but rather consider it a <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">set of classes to build a user
      interface</span>”</span>. In their view, it’s actually a variation of
      three other classical design patterns: the Observer (Pub/Sub),
      Strategy and Composite patterns. Depending on how MVC has been
      implemented in a framework, it may also use the Factory and
      Decorator patterns. I’ve covered some of these patterns in my
      other free book, JavaScript Design Patterns For Beginners if you
      would like to read into them further.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      As we’ve discussed, models represent application data, while views
      handle what the user is presented on screen. As such, MVC relies
      on Pub/Sub for some of its core communication (something that
      surprisingly isn’t covered in many articles about the MVC
      pattern). When a model is changed it <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">publishes</span>”</span> to
      the rest of the application that it has been updated. The
      <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">subscriber</span>”</span>–generally a Controller–then updates the
      view accordingly. The observer-viewer nature of this relationship
      is what facilitates multiple views being attached to the same
      model.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      For developers interested in knowing more about the decoupled
      nature of MVC (once again, depending on the implementation), one
      of the goals of the pattern is to help define one-to-many
      relationships between a topic and its observers. When a topic
      changes, its observers are updated. Views and controllers have a
      slightly different relationship. Controllers facilitate views to
      respond to different user input and are an example of the Strategy
      pattern.

      Having reviewed the classical MVC pattern, your should now
      understand how it allows developers to cleanly separate concerns
      in an application. You should also now appreciate how JavaScript
      MVC frameworks may differ in their interpretation of MVC, and how
      they share some of the fundamental concepts of the original
      pattern.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      When reviewing a new JavaScript MVC/MV* framework, remember - it
      can be useful to step back and consider how it’s opted to approach
      Models, Views, Controllers or other alternatives, as this can
      better help you grok how the framework expects to be used.
