    As JavaScript developers, we are at an interesting point in time
    where not only do we have mature solutions to help organize the
    JavaScript powering our applications based on a separation of
    concerns, but developers looking to build non-trivial projects are
    almost spoiled for choice for frameworks that can help structure
    their applications.
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    Maturity in software (framework) development isn’t simply about how
    long a framework has been around. It’s about how solid the framework
    is and more importantly how well it’s evolved to fill its role. Has
    it become more effective at solving common problems? Does it
    continue to improve as developers build larger and more complex
    applications with it?
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    In this book, I will be covering the popular Backbone.js, which I
    consider the best of the current family of JavaScript architectural
    frameworks.
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    Topics will include MVC theory and how to build applications using
    Backbone’s models, views, collections and routers. I’ll also be
    taking you through advanced topics like modular development with
    Backbone.js and AMD (via RequireJS), how to build applications using
    modern software stacks (like Node and Express), how to solve the
    routing problems with Backbone and jQuery Mobile, tips about
    scaffolding tools, and a lot more.
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    If this is your first time looking at Backbone.js and you’re still
    unsure whether or not to give it a try, why not take a look at how
    <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc">a Todo
    application</a> can be implemented in Backbone and several other
    popular Javascript frameworks before reading further?
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    The goal of this book is to create an authoritative and centralized
    repository of information that can help those developing real-world
    apps with Backbone. If you come across a section or topic which you
    think could be improved or expanded on, please feel free to submit a
    pull-request. It won’t take long and you’ll be helping other
    developers avoid problems you’ve run into before.

    In this section we are going to cover the context into which a
    framework like Backbone.js fits. Let’s begin our journey into
    understanding Backbone better with a look at code architecture.
  </p><div class="book" title="MVC, MVP &amp; Backbone.js"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title3"><a id="mvc-mvp-backbone.js" class="calibre1"></a>MVC, MVP &amp; Backbone.js</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre6">
      Before exploring any JavaScript frameworks that assist in
      structuring applications, it can be useful to gain a basic
      understanding of architectural design patterns. Design patterns
      are proven solutions to common development problems and can
      suggest structural approaches to help guide developers in adding
      some organization to their applications.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      Patterns are useful because they’re a set of practices that build
      upon the collective experience of skilled developers who have
      repeatedly solved similar problems. Although developers 10 or 20
      years ago may not have been using the same programming languages
      when implementing patterns in their projects, there are many
      lessons we can learn from their efforts.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      In this section, we’re going to review two popular patterns - MVC
      and MVP. We’ll be exploring in greater detail how Backbone.js
      implements these patterns shortly to better appreciate where it
      fits in.
