    MVP is generally used most often in enterprise-level applications
    where it’s necessary to reuse as much presentation logic as
    possible. Applications with very complex views and a great deal of
    user interaction may find that MVC doesn’t quite fit the bill here
    as solving this problem may mean heavily relying on multiple
    controllers. In MVP, all of this complex logic can be encapsulated
    in a presenter, which can simplify maintenance greatly.
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    As MVP views are defined through an interface and the interface is
    technically the only point of contact between the system and the
    view (other than a presenter), this pattern also allows developers
    to write presentation logic without needing to wait for designers to
    produce layouts and graphics for the application.
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    Depending on the implementation, MVP may be more easy to
    automatically unit test than MVC. The reason often cited for this is
    that the presenter can be used as a complete mock of the
    user-interface and so it can be unit tested independent of other
    components. In my experience this really depends on the languages
    you are implementing MVP in (there’s quite a difference between
    opting for MVP for a JavaScript project over one for say, ASP.net).
  </p><p class="calibre6">
    At the end of the day, the underlying concerns you may have with MVC
    will likely hold true for MVP given that the differences between
    them are mainly semantic. As long as you are cleanly separating
    concerns into models, views and controllers (or presenters) you
    should be achieving most of the same benefits regardless of the
    pattern you opt for.
