    MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural design pattern that
    encourages improved application organization through a separation of
    concerns. It enforces the isolation of business data (Models) from
    user interfaces (Views), with a third component (Controllers)
    traditionally present to manage logic, user-input and the
    coordination of models and views. The pattern was originally
    designed by
    <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug">Trygve
    Reenskaug</a> while working on Smalltalk-80 (1979), where it was
    initially called Model-View-Controller-Editor. MVC was described in
    depth in
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612"><span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Design
    Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
    Software</span>”</span></a> (The <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">GoF</span>”</span> or <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Gang of
    Four</span>”</span> book) in 1994, which played a role in popularizing its
    use.

      It’s important to understand what the original MVC pattern was
      aiming to solve as it has changed quite heavily since the days of
      its origin. Back in the 70’s, graphical user-interfaces were far
      and few between. An approach known as
      <a class="ulink" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">Separated
      Presentation</a> began to be used as a means to make a clear
      division between domain objects which modeled concepts in the real
      world (e.g a photo, a person) and the presentation objects which
      were rendered to the user’s screen.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      The Smalltalk-80 implementation of MVC took this concept further
      and had an objective of separating out the application logic from
      the user interface. The idea was that decoupling these parts of
      the application would also allow the reuse of models for other
      interfaces in the application. There are some interesting points
      worth noting about Smalltalk-80’s MVC architecture:
    </p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
          A Domain element was known as a Model and were ignorant of the
          user-interface (Views and Controllers)
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
          Presentation was taken care of by the View and the Controller,
          but there wasn’t just a single view and controller. A
          View-Controller pair was required for each element being
          displayed on the screen and so there was no true separation
          between them
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
          The Controller’s role in this pair was handling user input
          (such as key-presses and click events), doing something
          sensible with them.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre6">
          The Observer pattern was relied upon for updating the View
          whenever the Model changed
        </p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre6">
      Developers are sometimes surprised when they learn that the
      Observer pattern (nowadays commonly implemented as a
      Publish/Subscribe system) was included as a part of MVC’s
      architecture decades ago. In Smalltalk-80’s MVC, the View and
      Controller both observe the Model: anytime the Model changes, the
      Views react. A simple example of this is an application backed by
      stock market data - for the application to show real-time
      information, any change to the data in its Models should result in
      the View being refreshed instantly.

      Martin Fowler has done an excellent job of writing about the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">origins</a>
      of MVC over the years and if you are interested in further
      historical information about Smalltalk-80’s MVC, I recommend
      reading his work.
