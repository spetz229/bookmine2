      Backbone.js is one of a number of JavaScript frameworks for
      creating MVC-like web applications. On the front-end, it’s my
      architectural framework of choice as it’s both mature, relatively
      lightweight and can be easily tested using third-party toolkits
      such as Jasmine or QUnit. Other MVC frameworks you may be familiar
      with include Ember.js (SproutCore 2.0), Spine, YUILibrary and
      JavaScriptMVC.

      Backbone is maintained by a number of contributors, most notably:
      Jeremy Ashkenas, creator of CoffeeScript, Docco and Underscore.js.
      As Jeremy is a believer in detailed documentation, there’s a level
      of comfort in knowing you’re unlikely to run into issues which are
      either not explained in the official docs or which can’t be nailed
      down with some assistance from the #documentcloud IRC channel. I
      strongly recommend using the latter if you find yourself getting
      stuck.
