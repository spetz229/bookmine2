<p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre16"></a><a class="calibre16"></a>We have something new to say about building, running, and growing (or not growing) a business.</p>
<p class="calibre17">This book isn't based on academic theories. It's based on our experience. We've been in business for more than ten years. Along the way, we've seen two recessions, one burst bubble, business-model shifts, and doom-and-gloom predictions come and go--and we've remained profitable through it all.</p>
<p class="calibre17">We're an intentionally small company that makes software to help small companies and groups get things done the easy way. More than 3 million people around the world use our products.</p>
<p class="calibre17">We started out in 1999 as a three-person Web-design consulting firm. In 2004, we weren't happy with the project-management software used by the rest of the industry, so we created our own: Basecamp. When we showed the online tool to clients and colleagues, they all said the same thing: "We need this for our business too." Five years later, Basecamp generates millions of dollars a year in profits.</p>
<p class="calibre17"><a class="calibre16"></a>We now sell other online tools too. Highrise, our contact manager and simple CRM (customer relationship management) tool, is used by tens of thousands of small businesses to keep track of leads, deals, and more than 10 million contacts. More than 500,000 people have signed up for Backpack, our intranet and knowledge-sharing tool. And people have sent more than 100 million messages using Campfire, our real-time business chat tool. We also invented and open-sourced a computer-programming framework called Ruby on Rails that powers much of the Web 2.0 world.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Some people consider us an Internet company, but that makes us cringe. Internet companies are known for hiring compulsively, spending wildly, and failing spectacularly. That's not us. We're small (sixteen people as this book goes to press), frugal, and profitable.</p>
<p class="calibre17">A lot of people say we can't do what we do. They call us a fluke. They advise others to ignore our advice. Some have even called us irresponsible, reckless, and--gasp!--unprofessional.</p>
<p class="calibre17">These critics don't understand how a company can reject growth, meetings, budgets, boards of directors, advertising, salespeople, and "the real world," yet thrive. That's their problem, not ours. They say you need to sell to the Fortune 500. Screw that. We sell to the Fortune 5,000,000.</p>
<p class="calibre17"><a class="calibre16"></a>They don't think you can have employees who almost never see each other spread out across eight cities on two continents. They say you can't succeed without making financial projections and five-year plans. They're wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre17">They say you need a PR firm to make it into the pages of <em class="italic1">Time, Business Week, Inc., Fast Company</em>, the <em class="italic1">New York Times</em>, the <em class="italic1">Financial Times</em>, the <em class="italic1">Chicago Tribune</em>, the <em class="italic1">Atlantic, Entrepreneur</em>, and <em class="italic1">Wired</em>. They're wrong. They say you can't share your recipes and bare your secrets and still withstand the competition. Wrong again.</p>
<p class="calibre17">They say you can't possibly compete with the big boys without a hefty marketing and advertising budget. They say you can't succeed by building products that do less than your competition's. They say you can't make it all up as you go. But that's exactly what we've done.</p>
<p class="calibre17">They say a lot of things. We say they're wrong. We've <em class="italic1">proved</em> it. And we wrote this book to show you how to prove them wrong too.</p>
<p class="calibre17">First, we'll start out by gutting business. We'll take it down to the studs and explain why it's time to throw out the traditional notions of what it takes to run a business. Then we'll rebuild it. You'll learn how to begin, why you need less than you think, when to launch, how to get the word out, whom (and when) to hire, and how to keep it all under control.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Now, let's get on with it.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_6"></div></div>
