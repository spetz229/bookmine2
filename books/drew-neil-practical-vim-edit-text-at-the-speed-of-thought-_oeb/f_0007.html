<p id="N1014C" class="calibre4">
<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> is a recipe book. It’s not designed to be read from start to finish.
      (I mean it! At the start of the next chapter, I’ll advise you to skip it and jump straight to the action.)
      Each chapter is a collection of tips that are related by a theme, and each tip demonstrates a particular feature in action. Some tips are self-contained. Others depend upon material elsewhere in the book. Those tips are cross-referenced so you can find everything easily.
    </p>
<p id="N10151" class="calibre4">
<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> doesn’t progress from novice to advanced level, but each individual chapter does. A less-experienced reader might prefer to make a first pass through the book, reading just the early tips in each chapter. A more advanced reader might choose to focus on the later tips or move around the book as needed.
