    Conventional wisdom dictates that Vim has a steep learning curve. I think most Vim users would disagree. Sure, there’s an initial hump, but once you run through <code class="cf">vimtutor</code> and learn the basics of what to put in your <code class="cf">vimrc</code>, you reach a point where you can actually get work done—a sort of hobbled productivity.

    What comes next?  The Internet’s answer to this is the “tip”—a recipe for solving a specific problem.  You might search for specific tips when your current solution to a problem feels suboptimal, or you might proactively read some of the more popular tips.  This strategy works—it’s how I learned, after all—but it’s slow.  Learning that <span class="calibre17">*</span> searches for the word under the cursor is helpful, but it hardly helps you think like a Vim master.

    You can understand my skepticism, then, when I found out <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> was using a tips format.  How could a couple of hundred tips accomplish what took me thousands? A few pages in I realized my definition of “tip” was narrow-minded.  In contrast to the problem/solution pattern I had expected, <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> tips teach lessons in thinking like a proficient Vim user. In a sense, they are more like parables than recipes.  The first few tips are lessons about the wide applicability of the <span class="calibre17">.</span> command.  This is a staple of any proficient Vim user’s repertoire, yet without guidance it was years before I came to realize this on my own.

    It is for this reason that I am excited about the publication of <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span>.  Because now when Vim novices ask me what’s the next step, I know what to tell them. After all, <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> even taught me a few things.
