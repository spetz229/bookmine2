<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> is for programmers who want to raise their game. You’ve heard it said that in the hands of an expert, Vim shreds text at the speed of thought. Reading this book is your next step toward that end.
  </p>
<p id="N10132" class="calibre4">
<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> is a fast track to Vim mastery. It won’t hold you by the hand, but beginners can find the prerequisite knowledge by running through the Vim tutor, an interactive lesson distributed with Vim.<a id="FNPTR-1" href="f_0009.html#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>
<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> builds on this foundation by highlighting core concepts and demonstrating idiomatic usage.
  </p>
<p id="N1013F" class="calibre4">
    Vim is highly configurable. However, customization is a personal thing, so I’ve tried to avoid recommending what should or should not go into your <code class="cf">vimrc</code> file. Instead, <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> focuses on the core functionality of the editor—the stuff that’s always there, whether you’re working over SSH on a remote server or using a local instance of GVim, with plugins installed to add extra functionality. Master Vim’s core, and you’ll gain portable access to a text editing power tool.
