<h2 id="N10156" class="calibre19">A Note on the Examples</h2>
<p id="N1015A" class="calibre4">
      In Vim, there’s always more than one way to complete any given task. For example, in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0017.html#chp.the.vim.way">Chapter 1, ​<em class="calibre5">The Vim Way</em>​</a>, all of the problems are designed to illustrate an application of the dot command, but every one of them could also be solved using the <code class="cf">:substitute</code> command.
    </p>

      On seeing my solution, you might think to yourself, “Wouldn’t it be quicker to do it <span class="calibre5">this way</span>?” And you may well be right! My solutions illustrate a particular technique. Look beyond their simplicity, and try to find a resemblance to the problems that you face daily. That’s where these techniques will save you time.
