keyboard and start typing. We won't try to stop you;
turn to the section called "Starting
Emacs" and you can go ahead. But do read the
beginning of this chapter later when you're ready
for a break. Emacs is much easier to learn if you understand some of
the basic concepts involved, which we discuss in the following
introduction.</p><div class="book" xml:lang="en"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="gnu3-CHP-1-SECT-1" class="calibre1"></a>Introducing Emacs!</h1></div></div></div><p class="copyright">GNU Emacs is one of the
<a id="gnu3-CHP-1-ITERM-1466" class="calibre2"></a>
            <a id="gnu3-CHP-1-ITERM-1467" class="calibre2"></a>most
commonly used text editors in the world today. Many users prefer
Emacs to <span><strong class="calibre5">vi</strong></span> (Unix's
standard editor) or to other GUI text editors. Why is Emacs so
popular? It isn't the newest tool, and
it's certainly not the prettiest. But it may well be
the most useful tool you'll ever learn. We want to
present what you need to know about Emacs to do useful work, in a way
that lets you use it effectively. This book is a guide for Emacs
users; it tries to satisfy the needs of many readers, ranging from
casual users to programmers.</p><p class="copyright">Our approach therefore isn't to tell you absolutely
everything that Emacs does. It has many features and commands that
this book doesn't describe. We
don't think that's a problem; Emacs
has a comprehensive online help facility that helps you figure out
what these are. We focus our attention on describing how to get
useful work done. After covering basic editing in the first three
chapters, we describe how to use Emacs as a comprehensive working
environment: how to boost productivity with multiple buffers and
windows, how to give commands without leaving the editor, how to take
advantage of special editing modes, how to use Emacs for editing
special types of files (source files for various programming
languages), and so on. We cover the most important commands and the
most important editing modes. However, you should always keep one
principle in mind: Emacs does many things well, but it
isn't important for that reason. Emacs is important
because of the integration of different things you need to do.</p><p class="copyright">
            <a id="gnu3-CHP-1-ITERM-1468" class="calibre2"></a>What does
integration mean? A simple
<a id="gnu3-CHP-1-ITERM-1469" class="calibre2"></a>example
will help. Assume that someone sends you a mail message describing a
special command for accessing a new printer. You can fire up an Emacs
shell, paste the command into Emacs, and execute it directly. If it
works, you can edit your startup file to create an alias for the
command. You can do all this without leaving the editor and without
having to retype the command once. That's why Emacs
is so powerful. It's more than just an editor;
it's a complete environment that can change the way
you work.</p><p class="copyright">An initial word of advice, too. Many people think that Emacs is an
extremely difficult editor to learn. We don't see
why. Admittedly, it has a lot of features, and you probably will
never use all of them. But any editor, no matter how simple or
complex, has the same basic functions. If you can learn one, you can
learn any of them. We'll give you the standard
mnemonic devices that will help you remember commands (like
"<span><strong class="calibre5">C-p</strong></span> means previous
line"), but we really don't think
even these are necessary. They get you over an initial hump in the
learning process but don't make much difference in
the long run. Learning to use an editor is basically a matter of
learning finger habits: learning where <a id="gnu3-CHP-1-ITERM-1470" class="calibre2"></a>to put your fingers to move to the
previous line. If you experiment with Emacs and try typing a few of
our examples, you'll quickly acquire these finger
habits. And after you've acquired these habits,
you'll never forget, any more than
you'll forget how to ride a bicycle. After using
Emacs for a day or two, we never had to think,
"<span><strong class="calibre5">C-p</strong></span> means previous
line." Our fingers just knew where to go. Once
you're at this point, you're home.
You can become creative with Emacs and start thinking about how to
put its features to work for you. Emacs has extensive menus, but we
still recommend learning the key bindings for commonly used commands.
Good finger habits can make you an incredibly fast typist, and
reaching from keyboard to mouse only slows you down.</p><p class="copyright">The finger-habits approach also implies a different way of reading
this book. Intellectually, it's possible to absorb a
lot from one reading, but you can form only a few new habits each
day. (Unless, of course, they're bad habits.) <a class="calibre2" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Editing">Chapter 2</a> covers most of the basic editing techniques
you'll use. You may need to read it several times,
with a slightly different focus each time. For example, Emacs gives
you many different ways to move forward: you can move forward one
character, one word, one line, one sentence, one paragraph, one page,
and so on. All of these techniques are covered in <a class="calibre2" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Editing">Chapter 2</a>. Start by learning how to move forward and
backward, then gradually add more complex commands. Similarly, Emacs
provides many different techniques for searching through a file,
covered in <a class="calibre2" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Search and Replace">Chapter 3</a>. Don't
feel obliged to learn them all at once; pick something, practice it,
and move on to the next topic. No one will complain if you have to
work through the first three chapters of our book several times
before you're comfortable. Time spent developing
good habits is time well spent.</p></div></div></div>
