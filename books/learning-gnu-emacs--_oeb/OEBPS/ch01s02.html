            <a id="gnu3-CHP-1-ITERM-1472" class="calibre2"></a>edit
files with Emacs. Instead, Emacs copies the contents of a file into a
temporary buffer and you edit that. The file on disk
doesn't change until you save the buffer. Like
files, Emacs buffers have names. The name of a buffer is usually the
same as the name of the file that you're editing.
There are a few exceptions. Some buffers don't have
associated filesâ€”for example, <code class="calibre21">*scratch*</code> is
just a temporary practice buffer, like a scratchpad; the help
facility displays help messages in a buffer named
<code class="calibre21">*Help*</code>, which also isn't
connected to a file.</p></div></div>
