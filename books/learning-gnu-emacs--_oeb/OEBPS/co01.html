<div class="book" xml:lang="en"><h1 class="title"><a id="gnu3-COLOPHON" class="calibre1"></a>Colophon</h1><p class="copyright">Our look is the result of reader comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics, breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p><p class="copyright">The animal on the cover of Learning GNU Emacs, Third Edition is a gnu (or wildebeest). Gnus are African antelopes that inhabit the Serengeti Plains. Male gnus (bulls) reach up to 52 inches in height and 500 pounds inweight, and have the most lethal horns of any of the antelopes. Bulls are very territorial and tend to remain alone. The females and young generally live in small herds. However, they may congregate in the tens of thousands during migration. Gnus are the favorite prey of lions.</p><p class="copyright">Jamie Peppard was the production editor and proofreader for Learning GNU Emacs Third Edition. Nancy Reinhardt was the copyeditor  . Adam Witwer and Claire Cloutier provided quality control. Mary Agner provided production assistance. Johnna VanHoose Dinse wrote the index.</p><p class="copyright">Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book using a 19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Clay Fernald produced the cover layout with Quark Express 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font. Emma Colby produced the Quick Reference card with Adobe InDesign CS using the fonts Linotype Birka and Adobe Myriad Condensed.</p><p class="copyright">Melanie Wang designed the interior layout, based on a series design by David Futato.
