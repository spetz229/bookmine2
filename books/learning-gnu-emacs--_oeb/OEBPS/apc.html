but it is certainly possible to find things that
don't work correctly.</p><p class="copyright">The Free Software Foundation (FSF) welcomes problem reports. However,
they need to be real problem <a id="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3011" class="calibre2"></a>
         <a id="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3012" class="calibre2"></a>
         <a id="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3013" class="calibre2"></a>
         <a id="gnu3-APP-C-ITERM-3014" class="calibre2"></a>reports; simple differences of opinion
about how something should work are not bugs. If you think that a
certain command should work differently, remember that Emacs has been
around for a long time and has many users; it can't
be changed to satisfy a single user. (On the other hand, in most
cases, you could write some Lisp to change it yourself.) In the
<span><em class="calibre7">GNU Emacs Manual</em></span>, the FSF publishes some
excellent guidelines for reporting bugs, which we'll
summarize very quickly:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Before you report a bug, see if it's on the list of
known problems. You can view this list by typing <span><strong class="calibre5">C-h C-e</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">You most certainly have a bug if you run into some kind of system
error (Emacs dumps core, terminates with a segmentation fault,
crashes, hangs, or does something else antisocial).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">When reporting bugs, be as specific as possible. A few commands will
help you report exactly what was happening when things went awry.
<span><strong class="calibre5">C-h l</strong></span> (for <span><strong class="calibre5">view-lossage</strong></span>) reports the last 100 or so
keystrokes you made; <span><strong class="calibre5">M-x</strong></span> 
               <span><strong class="calibre5">open-dribble-file</strong></span>
               <span><em class="calibre7">filename</em></span> saves every keystroke you type in the
specified <span><em class="calibre7">filename</em></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">The FSF discourages you from trying to interpret bugs in the bug
report. "I did thus-and-such and this
happened" is useful, particularly if the problem is
repeatable; "I think there's a
problem with font handling" doesn't
give any useful information at all.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Always report which version of Emacs you are using. The command
<span><strong class="calibre5">M-x emacs-version</strong></span> gives you the
relevant information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Always report the contents of the file you were editing (if it makes
a difference), the contents of your <span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file,
which mode you were in, and any Lisp libraries (custom or otherwise)
that you have to load in order to create the problem.</p></li></ul></div><p class="copyright">We will add one very important guideline:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Although we have taken every effort to write a book that is accurate,
we are far from perfect. With that in mind, please <span><em class="calibre7">do
not</em></span> cite this book as an authority when reporting a bug.
Although we haven't asked, the Free Software
Foundation would be completely justified in rejecting any bug reports
based on a third-party publication. If you suspect a bug, use the
<span><em class="calibre7">GNU Emacs Manual</em></span> or the help facility to find
out what the command that's giving you trouble is
really supposed to do. In doing so, you may find out that this book
is incorrect; if you do, please report the problem to
<span><a class="calibre2" href="mailto:booktech@oreilly.com">booktech@oreilly.com</a></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p class="copyright">If you do have a bug to report, type <span><strong class="calibre5">M-x
report-emacs-bug</strong></span> to send it from within Emacs.
You'll be prompted for a subject line and dropped
into Emacs' interface for sending mail. If mail from
Emacs isn't set up properly, you can email
<span><a class="calibre2" href="mailto:emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org">emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org</a></span>
using your preferred mail client. Be sure to include an
informative subject line that summarizes the problem.</p></div></div>
