other editors (in particular, unlike the standard Unix editor,
<span><strong class="calibre5">vi</strong></span>), Emacs is a complete working
environment. No matter what you do, you can start Emacs in the
morning, work all day and all night, and never leave it: you can use
it to edit, rename, delete, and organize files; to compile programs;
to run shell commands; and so on. Before windowing systems like X and
Microsoft Windows became popular, Emacs often served as a complete
windowing system of its own. All you needed was a terminal, and you
could live within Emacs forever. Emacs is also infinitely flexible;
you can write your own commands, change the keys that are associated
with commands, and (if you are willing to take the time) do just
about anything you want.</p><div class="book" xml:lang="en"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-SECT-1" class="calibre1"></a>Why Read This Book?</h1></div></div></div><p class="copyright">Because it does so much, Emacs has a reputation for being extremely
complicated. We don't think that's
warranted; we teach you Emacs from the ground up, covering first the
basics and then some of the more advanced features.</p><p class="copyright">In this book, we have tried to reach as broad an audience as
possible: from casual users to professional writers and web authors
to programmers to system administrators. No matter what you do with
Emacs, you will find it's easy to learn; after one
or two sessions, you'll know the basics of editing
any file. After you learn the basics, you can go on to learn about
more advanced topics that provide the real benefits of using Emacs.
These include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Using multiple windows and buffers so you can work on several files
at once</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Customizing keyboard commands</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Tailoring Emacs to fit your work style</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Making Emacs your work environment where you can do all your everyday
tasks, such as organizing files, compiling programs, and issuing
shell commands</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Creating macros to streamline repetitive tasks</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Using Emacs to support programming in many languages (including C,
C++, Lisp, Java, and Perl)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Formatting files with various markup languages, such as HTML and XML</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Using word abbreviations to avoid spelling out long phrases or to
correct common misspellings</p></li></ul></div><p class="copyright">Of course, many of the topics may not apply to you; some topics may
be appropriate for a second reading but not for the first. Toward the
end of the preface, we'll sketch several different
ways to approach the book, depending on your interests and
experience.</p></div></div></div>
