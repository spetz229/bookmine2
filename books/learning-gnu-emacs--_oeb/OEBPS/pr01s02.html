            <a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-ITERM-1453" class="calibre2"></a>Numerous
versions of Emacs are available, offering a wide range of features,
but two are in widespread use today: GNU Emacs and XEmacs. (An
exhaustive list of Emacs implementations can be found at
<a class="calibre2" href="http://www.finseth.com/~fin/emacs.html">http://www.finseth.com/~fin/emacs.html</a>.) XEmacs
was originally tailored for GUI usage and has a fairly wide user
base, but lacks some of the features of GNU Emacs.<sup class="calibre6">[<a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-1" href="#ftn.gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-1" class="calibre2">1</a>]</sup>
         </p><p class="copyright">This book covers GNU Emacs. Since its appearance, GNU Emacs has
become the most popular, powerful, and flexible Emacs, and
there's no reason to believe that this situation
will change. If you know GNU Emacs, you will be able to adapt to any
other Emacs implementation with no trouble; it's not
so easy to go in the other direction.</p><p class="copyright">This book, however, isn't limited to GNU Emacs
users. Because of the similarities between different Emacs
implementations, this book should help you get started with any Emacs
editor. The basic keyboard commands change little from one editor to
anotherâ€”you'll find that <span><strong class="calibre5">C-n</strong></span> (for <span><strong class="calibre5">Ctrl-n</strong></span>) almost always means
"move to the next line." Emacs
editors tend to differ in the more advanced commands and features,
but if you are using these more advanced facilities and you
aren't using GNU Emacs, you should consider making
the switch.</p><div class="book"><br class="book"/><hr class="calibre4"/><div class="book"><p class="copyright"><sup class="calibre6">[<a id="ftn.gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-1" href="#gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-1" class="calibre2">1</a>] </sup>Quite a few issues come up in discussions of GNU Emacs versus XEmacs,
with character encoding schemes, user interface differences, and
copyright issues among them. We're not interested in
taking sides in the battles between these emacsen.</p></div></div></div></div>
