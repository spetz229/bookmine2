      </h2>
      
      
      
      <p class="noind"><i class="calibre9">Scala in Depth</i> is a practical guide to using Scala with deep dives into necessary topics. This book, picking up where introductory books
         drop off, enables readers to write idiomatic Scala code and understand trade-offs when making use of advanced language features.
         In particular, this book covers Scala’s implicit and type systems in detail before discussing how these can be used to drastically
         simplify development. The book promotes the “blended style” of Scala, where paradigms are mixed to achieve something greater.

      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind"><i class="calibre9">Scala in Depth</i> is for new or intermediate Scala developers who wish to improve their skills with the language. While this book covers very
         advanced concepts in Scala, it attempts to pull along those new to Scala.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">This book was written for readers who know Java or another object-oriented language. Prior experience with Scala is helpful
         but not required. It covers Scala 2.7.x through Scala 2.9.x.
      </p>

      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind"><i class="calibre9">Scala in Depth</i> begins with a philosophical discussion of the “xen” of Scala—that Scala is a blending of concepts that achieve a greater
         whole when combined. In particular, three dichotomies are discussed: static typing versus expressiveness, functional programming
         versus object-oriented programming, and powerful language features versus dead simple Java integration.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_010.html#ch02" class="calibre7">Chapter 2</a> is a discussion of the core rules of Scala. These are the things that every Scala developer should be aware of and make use
         of in daily development. This chapter is for every Scala developer and covers the basics that make Scala a great language.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_011.html#ch03" class="calibre7">Chapter 3</a> is a digression in code style and associated issues. Scala brings a few new players to the table, and any Scala style guide
         should reflect that. Some common conventions from popular languages like Ruby and Java can actually be deterrents to good
         Scala code.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_012.html#ch04" class="calibre7">Chapter 4</a> covers new issues arising in object-oriented design due to Scala’s mixin inheritance. One topic of interest to any Scala
         developer is the early initializer coverage, which gets little coverage in other books.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">After object orientation, the book moves into the implicit system. In <a href="kindle_split_013.html#ch05" class="calibre7">chapter 5</a>, rather than simply discussing best practices, a deep dive is taken into the mechanics of implicits in Scala. This chapter
         is a must for all Scala developers who wish to write expressive libraries and code.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_014.html#ch06" class="calibre7">Chapter 6</a> is devoted to Scala’s type system. The discussion covers all the ways types appear in Scala and how to utilize the type system
         to enforce constraints. The chapter moves into a discussion of higher-kinded types and finishes with a dive into existential
         types.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_015.html#ch07" class="calibre7">Chapter 7</a> discusses the most advanced usage patterns in the language, the intersection of types and implicits. This intersection is
         where a lot of interesting and powerful abstractions occur, the epitome of which is the type class pattern.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Having covered the most advanced aspects of Scala, in <a href="kindle_split_016.html#ch08" class="calibre7">chapter 8</a> we move into a discussion of Scala’s collection library. This includes the design and performance of Scala’s collections
         as well as how to deal with the powerful type mechanisms.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_017.html#ch09" class="calibre7">Chapter 9</a> kicks off the discussion on actors in Scala. Actors are a concurrency mechanism that can provide great throughput and parallelism
         when used appropriately. The chapter dives into issues of designing actor-based systems and finishes with a demonstration
         of how the Akka actors library provides best practices by default.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_018.html#ch10" class="calibre7">Chapter 10</a> covers Java integration with Scala. While Scala is more compatible with Java than most other JVM languages, there’s still
         a mismatch in features between the two. It’s at these corners that issues arise in Scala-Java integration and this chapter
         provides a few simple rules that help avoid these issues.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_019.html#ch11" class="calibre7">Chapter 11</a> takes concepts from category theory and makes them practical. In pure functional programming, a lot of concepts from category
         theory have been applied to code. These are akin to object-oriented design patterns, but far more abstract. While they have
         terrible names, as is common in mathematics, these concepts are immensely useful in practice. No coverage of functional programming
         would be complete without a discussion of some of these abstractions, and Scala in Depth does its best to make these concepts
         real.

      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind">All source code in the book is in a <kbd class="calibre18">fixed-width font like this</kbd>, which sets it off from the surrounding text. In many listings, the code is annotated to point out the key concepts. I have
         tried to format the code so that it fits within the available page space in the book by adding line breaks and using indentation
         carefully. Sometimes, however, very long lines include line-continuation markers.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Source code for all the working examples is available from <a href="http://www.manning.com/ScalainDepth" class="calibre7">www.manning.com/ScalainDepth</a> and at <a href="https://github.com/jsuereth/scala-in-depth-source" class="calibre7">https://github.com/jsuereth/scala-in-depth-source</a>. To run the examples, readers should have Scala installed and, optionally, SBT (<a href="http://scalasbt.org" class="calibre7">http://scalasbt.org</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Code examples appear throughout this book. Longer listings appear under clear listing headers; shorter listings appear between
         lines of text.

      <p class="noind">He introduced Scala into his company code base in 2007, and soon after he was infected by Scala fever, contributing to the
         Scala IDE, maven-scala-plugin and Scala itself. Today, Josh is the author of several open source Scala projects, including
         the Scala automated resource management library and the PGP sbt plugin, as well as contributing to key components in the Scala
         ecosystem, like the maven-scala-plugin. His current work at Typesafe Inc., has him doing everything from building MSIs to
