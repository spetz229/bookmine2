      </h2>
      
      
      
      <p class="noind">On the cover of <i class="calibre9">Scala in Depth</i> is a figure dressed in “An old Croatian folk costume.” The illustration is taken from a reproduction of an album of Croatian
         traditional costumes from the mid-nineteenth century by Nikola Arsenovic, published by the Ethnographic Museum in Split, Croatia,
         in 2003. The illustrations were obtained from a helpful librarian at the Ethnographic Museum in Split, itself situated in
         the Roman core of the medieval center of the town: the ruins of Emperor Diocletian’s retirement palace from around AD 304.
         The book includes finely colored illustrations of figures from different regions of Croatia, accompanied by descriptions of
         the costumes and of everyday life.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">While the caption for the illustration on the cover does not tell us the town or region of origin, the blue woolen trousers
         and richly embroidered vest and jacket that the figure is wearing are typical for the mountainous regions of central Croatia.
         Dress codes and lifestyles have changed over the last 200 years, and the diversity by region, so rich at the time, has faded
         away. It’s now hard to tell apart the inhabitants of different continents, let alone of different hamlets or towns separated
         by only a few miles. Perhaps we have traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life—certainly for a more varied
         and fast-paced technological life.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Manning celebrates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity
         of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by illustrations from old books and collections like this one.
