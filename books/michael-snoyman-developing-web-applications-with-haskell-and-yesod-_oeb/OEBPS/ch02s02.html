<div class="book" title="Tools"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect12_d1e535" class="calibre1"></a>Tools</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">There are two main tools you’ll need to develop in Haskell. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
      (GHC) is the standard Haskell compiler, and the only one officially supported by Yesod. You’ll
      also need Cabal, which is the standard Haskell build tool. Not only do we use Cabal for
      building our local code, but it can automatically download and install dependencies from
      Hackage, the Haskell package repository.</p><p class="calibre7">If you’re on Windows or Mac, it is strongly recommended that you download the <a class="ulink" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. On Linux, many
      distributions include the Haskell Platform in their repositories. On Debian-based systems, for
      example, you can get started by running <code class="literal">sudo apt-get install
        haskell-platform</code>. If your distribution does not include the Haskell Platform, you
      can install it manually by following the instructions on the Haskell Platform page.</p><p class="calibre7">One important tool you’ll need to update is <em class="calibre4">alex</em>. The
      Haskell Platform includes version 2, while the JavaScript minifier Yesod uses, <code class="function">hjsmin</code>, requires version three. Be sure to <em class="calibre4">cabal install alex</em> after getting set up with the Haskell Platform,
      or you’ll run into error messages about the <code class="function">language-javascript</code> package.</p><div class="tip" title="Note"><h3 class="title3">Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Some people like to live on the bleeding edge and install the latest version of GHC
        before it is available in the Haskell Platform. We try to keep Yesod up-to-date with all
        current versions of GHC, but we only officially support the Haskell Platform. If you do go
        the route of manually installing GHC, here are a few notes:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">You’ll need to install some additional build tools, <em class="calibre4">alex</em> and <em class="calibre4">happy</em> in particular.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Make sure to install all of the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vex.net/%7Etrebla/haskell/haskell-platform.xhtml">required C
                libraries</a>. On Debian-based systems, you would need to
              run:<a id="I_programlisting2_d1e587" class="firstname"></a></p><pre class="programlisting">sudo apt-get install libedit-dev libbsd-dev libgmp3-dev zlib1g-dev freeglut3-dev</pre><p class="calibre7">
            </p></li></ul></div></div><p class="calibre7">Regardless of how you’ve installed your tools, you should be sure to put <code class="literal">cabal</code>’s bin folder in your <code class="literal">PATH</code>
      variable. On Mac and Linux, this will be <code class="literal">$HOME/.cabal/bin</code>
      and on Windows it will be <code class="literal">%APPDATA%\cabal\bin</code>.</p><p class="calibre7"><code class="literal">cabal</code> has lots of different options available, but for now, just try out two
   commands:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre4">cabal update</em> will download the most recent list of packages from
    Hackage.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre4">cabal install yesod</em> will install Yesod and all its dependencies.</p></li></ul></div><div class="tip" title="Note"><h3 class="title3">Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Many people in the community prefer to perform sandboxed builds of their Haskell
        packages, which prevents your install of Yesod from breaking existing packages, or packages
        you install in the future, from breaking your Yesod install. I won’t go into detail on how
        to use these in this book, but the two most commonly used tools are <a class="ulink" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-dev">cabal-dev</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/virthualenv">virthualenv</a>.</p></div></div></div>
