<div class="book" title="Acknowledgements"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect1_d1e292" class="calibre1"></a>Acknowledgements</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Yesod has been created by an entire community of developers, all of whom have put in
      significant effort to make sure that the final product is as polished and user-friendly as
      possible. Everyone from the core development team to the person making an API request on the
      mailing list has had an impact on bringing Yesod to where it is today.</p><p class="calibre7">In particular, I’d like to thank Greg Weber, who has shared the maintenance burden of the
      project; Kazu Yamamoto and Matt Brown, who transformed Warp from a simple testing server to
      one of the fastest application servers available today; and Felipe Lessa, Patrick Brisbin, and
      Luite Stegeman for their numerous contributions across the board.</p><p class="calibre7">A big thank you to my editor, Simon St. Laurent, for all of his guidance and support. Mark
      Lentczner, Johan Tibell, and Adam Turoff provided incredibly thorough reviews of this book,
      cleaning up many of my mistakes. Additionally, there have been dozens of readers who have
      looked over the content of this book online, and provided feedback on where either the prose
      or the message was not coming through clearly—not to mention numerous spelling
      errors.</p><p class="calibre7">But finally, and most importantly, I’d like to thank my wife, Miriam, for enduring all of
      the time spent on both this book and Yesod in general. She has been my editor and
      sounding-board, though I’m sure the intricacies of Template Haskell sometimes worked more as a
      sedative than any meaningful conversation. Without her support, neither the Yesod project nor
      this book would have been able to happen.</p><p class="calibre7">Also, you’ll notice that I use my kids’ names (Eliezer and Gavriella) in some examples
      throughout the book. They deserve special mention in a Haskell text, since I think they’re the
      youngest people to ever use the word “monad” in a sentence with their “Transformers: Monads in
      Disguise.”</p></div></div>
