      resources with that data type and define some handler functions, and Yesod handles all of the
      routing. These resources are also data constructors, which lets us have type-safe URLs.</p><p class="calibre7">By being built on top of WAI, Yesod applications can run with a number of different
            backends. <code class="literal">warpDebug</code> is an easy way to get started, as
            it’s included with Yesod. For rapid development, you can use <code class="literal">yesod devel</code>. And when you’re ready to move to production, you have Warp
            as a high-performance option.</p><p class="calibre7">When developing in Yesod, we get a number of choices for coding style: quasi-quotation or
      external files, <code class="literal">warpDebug</code> or <code class="literal">yesod
        devel</code>, and so on. The examples in this book will tend toward using the choices
      that are easiest to copy and paste, but the more powerful options will be available when you
      start building real Yesod applications.</p></div></div>
