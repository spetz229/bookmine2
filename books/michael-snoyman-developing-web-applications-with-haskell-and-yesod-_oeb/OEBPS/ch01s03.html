      improving all the time. This choice of language by itself gives Yesod a large performance
      advantage over other offerings. But that’s not enough: we need an architecture designed for
      performance.</p><p class="calibre7">Our approach to templates is one example: by allowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be
      analyzed at compile time, Yesod both avoids costly disk I/O at runtime and can optimize the
      rendering of this code. But the architectural decisions go deeper: we use advanced techniques
      such as conduits and builders in the underlying libraries to make sure our code runs in
      constant memory, without exhausting precious file handles and other resources. By offering
      high-level abstractions, you can get highly compressed and properly cached CSS and
      JavaScript.</p><p class="calibre7">Yesod’s flagship web server, Warp, is the fastest Haskell web server around. When these
      two pieces of technology are combined, it produces one of the fastest web application
      deployment solutions available.</p></div></div>
