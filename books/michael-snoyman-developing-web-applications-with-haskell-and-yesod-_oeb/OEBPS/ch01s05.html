This struck me as
      surprising: you mean having UTF-8 support isnâ€™t automatic? In the Haskell world, issues like
      character encoding are already well addressed and fully supported. In fact, we usually have
      the opposite problem: there are a number of packages providing powerful and well-designed
      support for the problem. The Haskell community is constantly pushing the boundaries finding
      the cleanest, most efficient solutions for each challenge.</p><p class="calibre7">The downside of such a powerful ecosystem is the complexity of choice. By using Yesod, you will already have most of the tools chosen for you, and you can be guaranteed they work together. Of course, you always have the option of pulling in your own solution.</p><p class="calibre7">As a real-life example, Yesod and Hamlet (the default templating language) use <code class="function">blaze-builder</code> for textual content generation. This choice was made because blaze provides the fastest interface for generating UTF-8 data. Anyone who wants to use one of the other great libraries out there, such as <code class="function">text</code>, should have no problem dropping it in.</p></div></div>
