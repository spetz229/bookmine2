                <code class="literal">GET</code> requests. How do you define your response?
            You write a <em class="calibre4">handler function</em>. Yesod follows a standard naming
            scheme for these functions: it’s the lower case method name (e.g., <code class="literal">GET</code> becomes <code class="literal">get</code>)
            followed by the route name. In this case, the function name would be <code class="literal">getHomeR</code>.</p><p class="calibre7">Most of the code you write in Yesod lives in handler functions. This is where you process
            user input, perform database queries, and create responses. In our simple example, we
            create a response using the <code class="literal">defaultLayout</code> function.
            This function wraps up the content it’s given in your site’s template. By default, it
            produces an HTML file with a doctype and <code class="literal">html</code>,
                <code class="literal">head</code>, and <code class="literal">body</code>
            tags. As we’ll see in the Yesod typeclass chapter, this function can be overridden to do
            much more.</p><p class="calibre7">In our example, we pass <code class="literal">[whamlet|Hello World!|]</code> to
                <code class="literal">defaultLayout</code>. <code class="literal">whamlet</code> is another quasi-quoter. In this case, it converts Hamlet syntax
            into a Widget. Hamlet is the default HTML templating engine in Yesod. Together with its
            siblings Cassius, Lucius, and Julius, you can create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a
            fully type-safe and compile-time-checked manner. We’ll see much more about this in the
            Shakespeare chapter.</p><p class="calibre7">Widgets are another cornerstone of Yesod. They allow you to create modular components of a
            site consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and reuse them throughout your site. We’ll
            get into more detail on them in the widgets chapter.</p></div></div>
