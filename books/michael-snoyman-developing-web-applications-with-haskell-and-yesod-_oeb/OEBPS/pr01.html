    Python, and PHP are common choices for quickly creating a powerful web application. They give a
    much faster and more comfortable development setting than standard static languages in the C
    family, like Java.</p><p class="calibre7">But some of us are looking for something more in our development toolbox. We want a language
    that gives us guarantees that our code is doing what it should. Instead of writing up a unit
    test to cover every bit of functionality in our application, wouldn’t it be wonderful if the
    compiler could <span class="firstname"><em class="calibre4">automatically</em></span> ensure that our code is correct? And as an
    added bonus, wouldn’t it be nice if our code ran quickly too?</p><p class="calibre7">These are the goals of Yesod. Yesod is a web framework bringing the strengths of the Haskell
    programming language to the web development world. Yesod not only uses a pure language to
    interact with an impure world, it allows safe interactions with the outside world by
    automatically sanitizing incoming and outgoing data. Not only do we avoid basic mistakes such as
    mixing up integers and strings, it even allows us to statically prevent many cases of security
    holes like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p><div class="book" title="Who This Book Is For"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre8"></div><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect1_d1e135" class="calibre1"></a>Who This Book Is For</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">In general, there are two groups of people coming to Yesod. The first group is long time
      Haskell users—already convinced of the advantages of Haskell—who are looking for a
      powerful framework for creating web applications. The second is web developers who are either
      dissatisfied with their existing tools, or are looking to expand their horizons into the
      functional world.</p><p class="calibre7">This book assumes a basic familiarity with both web development and Haskell. We don’t use
      many complicated Haskell concepts, and those we do use are introduced separately. For the most
      part, understanding the basics of the syntax of the language should be sufficient.</p><p class="calibre7">If you want to come up to speed on Haskell, I recommend another wonderful O’Reilly book:
      <a class="ulink" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596514983.do"><span class="firstname">Real World Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></div></div>
