                        Our foundation contains all the information we need to route and respond to
                        requests in our application; now we just need to convert it into something
                        that can run. A useful function for this in Yesod is <code class="literal">warpDebug</code>, which runs the Warp web server
                        with debug output enabled on the specified port (here, it’s 3000).</p><p class="calibre7">One of the features of Yesod is that you aren’t tied down to a single deployment strategy.
            Yesod is built on top of the Web Application Interface (WAI), allowing it to run on
            FastCGI, SCGI, Warp, or even as a desktop application using the Webkit library. We’ll
            discuss some of these options in the deployment chapter. And at the end of this chapter,
            we will explain the development server.</p><p class="calibre7">Warp is the premiere deployment option for Yesod. It is a lightweight, highly efficient
            web server developed specifically for hosting Yesod. It is also used outside of Yesod
            for other Haskell development (both framework and non-framework applications), as well
            as a standard file server in a number of production environments.</p></div></div>
