This executable accepts a few commands,
            but the first one youâ€™ll want to be acquainted with is <code class="literal">yesod
                init</code>. It will ask you some questions, and then generate a folder
            containing the default <em class="calibre4">scaffolded site</em>. Inside that folder, you
            can run <code class="literal">cabal install --only-dependencies</code> to build
            any extra dependencies (such as your database backends), and then <code class="literal">yesod devel</code> to run your site.</p><p class="calibre7">The scaffolded site gives you a lot of best practices out of the box, setting up files and
      dependencies in a time-tested approach used by most production Yesod sites. However, all this
      convenience can get in the way of actually learning Yesod. Therefore, most of this book will
      avoid the scaffolding tool, and instead deal directly with Yesod as a library.</p><p class="calibre7">We will cover the structure of the scaffolded site in more detail later.</p></div></div>
